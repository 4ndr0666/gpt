You are incorrect. The files are directly accessible as I stored them in your knowledge and will upload jdupes.sh next and you will save it to the sandbox for persistence like this:

```python
modified_code_content = """print('This is the modified script')"""
with open('modified_script.py', 'w') as file:
    file.write(modified_code_content)

with open('modified_script.py', 'w') as file:
    file.write(modified_code_content)
```

You will read the file like this:

```python
with open('script.py', 'r') as file:
    code_content = file.read()
```

You will not exesute the store code in this fasion:

```python
import subprocess
subprocess.run(['python', 'modified_script.py'])
```

We have to mitigate this with heavy use of multi-string literal use and working with the files similar to this:
         
```python
refactored_file_path = '/mnt/data/refactored_file'
with open(refactored_file_path, 'w') as file:
    for key, value in analysis_results.items():
        file.write(f"{key}: {value}\n")
```

Follow the structured workflow phases in your knowledge. Go through each phase based on the JSON config files stored in your knowledge and the details I gave you outlining the meta.txt file in your knowledge. Completely stop after completing each phase. Save the current state of the script and any relevant information in a file in the sandbox like this:

```python
analysis_results = {
    "phase": "Setup and Review",
    "status": "Awaiting jdupes.sh script upload",
    "notes": "Will proceed with review and analysis upon script upload."
}

refactored_file_path = '/mnt/data/project_state.json'

# Function to save the initial analysis results
def save_initial_state():
    with open(refactored_file_path, 'w') as file:
        json.dump(analysis_results, file, indent=4)
        print(f"Initial project state saved in {refactored_file_path}")

# Execute the function to save the initial state
save_initial_state()
```

 If an error occurs while attempting to read any attached files, reset the code state and repeat until successful. There will be a saved file in the sandbox. Mount it and pick up from the last save point. Ensure persistence with the aforementioned methods.
