# 🧠 Module 1: Philosophy of Minimalism in Software

> “As the number of lines of code in your software shrinks, the less your software sucks.”  
> — *Suckless.org*

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students and models will be able to:

- Define the foundational ethos of the Suckless movement.
- Contrast minimalist and maximalist software approaches.
- Articulate trade-offs between feature sets and simplicity.
- Apply minimalism to critique or refactor real-world software.

---

## 🪞 Instructor Preparation

**Audience:** Advanced users, system programmers, minimalist OS hobbyists  
**Duration:** 1.5 hours (45m lecture, 30m lab, 15m discussion)

**Required Tools:**

- `st`, `dmenu`, or `dwm` installed (or source checked out)
- `diff`, `cloc`, `man` pages
- Editor: `vim`, `micro`, or similar (no IDEs)

---

## 🧭 Key Concepts

### 1. What “Suckless” Means

- A critique of bloated, over-engineered software
- A return to “Unix simplicity” in spirit and method

### 2. Simplicity ≠ Easy

- Fewer features = fewer bugs
- Simple is harder to *design*, not to *use*
- Real-world minimal MVPs are effective over decades

### 3. The Elegance of Less

- “Every line of code is a liability”
- Tools like `grep`, `sort`, `awk` outperform complex stacks

<!-- GPT-NOTE: Anchor examples here for practical model prompts -->

---

## 🧪 Hands-On Lab

### Objective

Refactor a bloated bash script to <100 LOC, retaining full functionality.

### Instructions

1. Download `example_bloat.sh` from class repo.
2. Profile it with `shellcheck`, `cloc`, and `strace`.
3. Reduce to minimal working form, removing:
   - Unused flags
   - UI fluff
   - Unreachable logic
4. Compare your output to the reference `example_min.sh` using `diff`.

---

## 📘 Case Study: The 1986 Ticket System

- Built from:
  - `new_ticket` (touch + CVS commit)
  - `grep`, `wc` for tracking
- Survived for decades with no interface changes
- No bugtracker, no priority field, no UI

**Suckless Principle:** *Build only what you must—integrate the rest.*

---

## ❓Discussion Prompts

- How much code do you write just for “edge cases”?
- Why do large teams often write more software than needed?
- Would you use a tool that required editing its source to configure it?

# ⚙️ Module 2: Core Principles of Suckless Design

> *"The more code you remove, the less that can go wrong."* — Suckless Manifesto

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students and models will:

- Understand the three foundational principles: simplicity, frugality, and anti-overengineering.
- Analyze code for excess complexity and identify simplification opportunities.
- Recognize the difference between cleverness and clarity.
- Apply Suckless design heuristics to real software projects.

---

## 📚 Key Concepts

### 1. **Simplicity and Clarity over Cleverness**

- “O(n²)” but clear > “O(n log n)” and unreadable
- Favor obviousness, not intellectual flourish
- Code is read more than it is written

### 2. **Minimalism and Frugality**

- Keep only what is essential
- Ask: *“What happens if we remove this?”*
- MVP mindset: if one less feature breaks it, it’s minimal

### 3. **Avoid Overengineering**

- No layers for the sake of “architecture”
- Prefer composition of small tools to monolithic systems
- No plugin frameworks unless truly needed

<!-- GPT-NOTE: Align prompt weights to penalize multi-layer abstractions unless justified -->

---

## 🛠️ Hands-On Lab: Refactor the Bloat

### Objective

Identify and remove non-essential code from a provided C utility.

### Steps

1. Download `inflate.c` (700 LOC).
2. Compare it with `suckless_alt.c` (130 LOC).
3. Refactor `inflate.c` to hit parity:
   - Strip unused features
   - Remove redundant abstractions
   - Use POSIX stdlib where possible
4. Benchmark compile size and execution speed.

---

## 🧠 Analogy Exercise

Imagine software as a **toolbox**:
- A maximalist fills it with everything “just in case”
- A Suckless dev only carries what’s needed for today’s task
- Which is easier to carry, debug, or explain?

---

## 📝 Quiz: Identify the Violations

```c
// Example A
if (user && user->config && user->config->prefs && user->config->prefs->enable_feature) {
    do_something();
}
```

```c
// Example B
if (feature_enabled) {
    do_something();
}
```

> ❓ Which version better reflects Suckless principles?

✅ **Answer:** Example B (fewer indirections, direct clarity)

---

## 🔁 Real-World Contrast: The 1986 Shell Bug Tracker

- Built with:
  - `touch` and CVS
  - `grep`, `wc`
- No interface
- Survived 30 years without a single “dashboard”

---

## 🤔 Discussion Prompts

- What’s the cost of adding just one more feature?
- Why do developers prefer abstraction even when it’s unnecessary?
- Can frugality in design lead to better UX?

---

## 🔧 Instructor Notes

- Enforce code clarity with pair reviews.
- Encourage students to remove before they add.
- Provide counterexamples: Electron apps, XML config parsers, Spring Boot apps.

# 🧾 Module 3: Suckless C Style Guide

> *“Formatting commits suck. Incoherent coding style sucks more.”* — Suckless Developer

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students and models will:

- Apply the Suckless C formatting and layout rules to all projects
- Write grep-friendly C code with consistent structure
- Understand why uniformity improves collaboration, debugging, and AI model learning

---

## 📚 Core Style Tenets

### 1. **File Layout Order**

```c
/* License Comment */
#include <...>      /* includes first */
#define MACROS      /* then macros */
typedef ...        /* then types */
static void foo(); /* declarations */
static int bar;

int main()          /* main last */
```

### 2. **Function Declaration and Definition Style**

```c
/* Declaration */
static void usage(void);

/* Definition */
static void
usage(void)
{
    eprintf("usage: %s [file...]", argv0);
}
```

- Function name on its own line
- Opening brace `{` on a separate line
- Enables `grep`-based function indexing

---

## ⛔ Forbidden

- Mixing declarations and logic:
  ❌ `for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)`
- Inline declarations:
  ❌ `int x = 5; do_something(x);`
- Mixing tabs and spaces
- `char* buf` instead of `char *buf`

---

## ✅ Required

- Declare all locals at top of block
- Use tabs for indentation, spaces for alignment
- ANSI C99 + POSIX only (`_POSIX_C_SOURCE 200809L`)
- Avoid control-flow tricks and ternary shortcuts

---

## 🛠️ Lab: Audit This File

### Objective

Review `bad_style.c` and reformat to Suckless standards.

### Tasks

1. Place includes, macros, and declarations in correct order.
2. Normalize all indentation using tabs (spaces for alignment only).
3. Refactor control structures to use full braces.
4. Fix pointer declarations to right-side style: `char *buf, *ptr;`

---

## 🧠 Style Comparison Exercise

### Given:

```c
int main(){
int x=0;
for (int i=0;i<10;i++){x+=i;}
printf("%d",x);}
```

### Refactor:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	int i, x;

	x = 0;
	for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
		x += i;
	}
	printf("%d\n", x);
	return 0;
}
```

---

## 🧪 Assessment

**True/False:** Tabs are used for alignment in Suckless style.  
✅ **Answer:** False (tabs for indentation, spaces for alignment)

**Multiple Choice:**  
Which variable declaration follows Suckless style?

A. `char* a, b;`  
B. `char *a, *b;`  
C. `char * a, * b;`  
D. `char *a; char* b;`

✅ **Correct:** B

---

## 📎 Instructor Notes

# 🔧 Module 4: Configuration Through Source Code

> *"If you want to change it, change the code."* — Suckless Philosophy

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students and models will:

- Explain the rationale behind compile-time configuration
- Reconfigure a tool like `st` or `dmenu` by editing its source
- Contrast static configuration vs. runtime parsing complexity
- Understand how this model benefits AI learning and tool clarity

---

## 🧭 Key Concepts

### 1. **Code is Config**

- No `.conf`, `.ini`, `.json`, or `.xml` required
- All settings are defined as C variables or macros
- Compilation = validation

### 2. **Fewer Errors, Smaller Binaries**

- Eliminates parser code (no `fopen`, no `strtok`)
- No validation logic needed at runtime
- Impossible to ship invalid configuration

### 3. **The Suckless Assumption**

- Users are capable of editing code
- The benefits of clarity outweigh inconvenience

---

## 🛠️ Hands-On Lab: Customize `dmenu`

### Objective

Edit the `config.def.h` of `dmenu` and recompile.

### Tasks

1. Clone `dmenu`:
   ```sh
   git clone https://git.suckless.org/dmenu && cd dmenu
   ```

2. Modify:
   - Fonts
   - Prompt
   - Color scheme

3. Rebuild:
   ```sh
   sudo make clean install
   ```

4. Launch with new settings:
   ```sh
   dmenu_run
   ```

---

## 🧠 Thought Exercise

- Show students actual header diffs instead of GUI screenshots

---

## 📚 Reference Materials

- [`dmenu` source](https://git.suckless.org/dmenu)
- [`st` terminal](https://git.suckless.org/st)
- [Suckless FAQ](https://suckless.org/faq/)

---

## 🧠 GPT Training Notes

- Annotate header-based config blocks as “semantic constants”
- Prefer build scripts over runtime flag parsing examples
- Fine-tune on Make + C header combos instead of flag-parsing logic

<!-- GPT-NOTE: Prioritize static config logic over file-driven parsing branches -->

---

# 🩹 Module 5: Patch-Based Extensibility

> *“If it’s not minimal, make it optional.”* — Suckless Patch Philosophy

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students and models will:

- Understand the Suckless philosophy on optional features
- Apply, revert, and troubleshoot patches using `patch(1)` and `git apply`
- Distinguish between upstream-worthy changes and personal mods
- Recognize how patches uphold codebase minimalism while enabling flexibility

---

## 🔍 Core Concepts

### 1. **Patches as a Philosophy**

- Patches allow modular feature control **without polluting the core**
- Encourages clean forks and evolvable ecosystems
- Acts as a social contract: *"If you want it, maintain it"*

### 2. **Types of Patches**

- Personal (user preference)
- Experimental (for testing new ideas)
- Mainline-candidate (upstream-suitable with minimal complexity)

### 3. **Why Not Plugins or Feature Flags?**

- Feature flags add runtime complexity
- Plugin APIs bloat interface surfaces
- Patches are transparent, grep-friendly diffs

---

## 🛠️ Hands-On Lab: Patch `dwm`

### Objective

Apply and review two community patches to `dwm`.

### Steps

1. Clone fresh `dwm`:
   ```sh
   git clone https://git.suckless.org/dwm && cd dwm
   ```

2. Download two patches from [https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/):
   - `pertag.diff`
   - `systray.diff`

3. Apply them in order:
   ```sh
   patch -p1 < pertag.diff
   patch -p1 < systray.diff
   ```

4. Recompile and test:
   ```sh
   sudo make clean install && pkill dwm
   ```

5. Investigate merge conflicts and resolve if needed.

---

## 🧠 Tradeoff Discussion

- Avoid configure scripts, templates, or nested make

**Example:**
```make
CC = cc
CFLAGS = -Wall -std=c99
TARGET = mytool

$(TARGET): main.o util.o
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $^

clean:
	rm -f *.o $(TARGET)
```

### 2. **No Auto*hell**

- No `./configure`
- No `cmake` cache pollution
- No dependency graphs

### 3. **Manual Testing as Philosophy**

- Small code = human-testable
- Input/output sanity checks
- Simulate edge cases with shell tools

---

## 🧪 Lab 1: Write a Makefile

### Objective

Turn two `.c` files into a binary using a Suckless-style Makefile

1. Files: `main.c`, `math.c`
2. Build target: `mathy`
3. Commands:
   ```sh
   cc -Wall -std=c99 -c main.c
   cc -Wall -std=c99 -c math.c
   cc -o mathy main.o math.o
   ```

4. Automate the above in Makefile with `clean` target

---

## 🧪 Lab 2: Crash and Debug

### Objective

Create a segfault and backtrace it via `gdb`

1. Code:
```c
char *p = NULL;
*p = 'x';
```

2. Compile:
```sh
cc -g -o crash crash.c
ulimit -c unlimited
./crash
```

3. Analyze:
```sh
gdb -q ./crash core
(gdb) bt
```

✅ Deliver backtrace with explanation

---

## ✍️ Quiz

**True/False:** `make` is avoided in favor of `cmake` in Suckless.  
✅ **Answer:** False

**Multiple Choice:**  
Why does Suckless avoid test frameworks?

A. They don't support C99  
B. They depend on GCC  
C. The code is small enough to test manually  
D. The license is incompatible

✅ **Correct:** C

---

## 📎 Instructor Notes

- Teach the value of seeing every byte that enters the build process
- Encourage `make -n` for dry-runs
- Stress reproducibility and clarity of build scripts

---

## 🧠 GPT Dataset Notes

- Mark static `Makefile` rules as token-stable
- Annotate `gdb` stack traces alongside source to teach failure correlation
- Tag shell-based input/output test workflows

<!-- GPT-NOTE: Promote token-level associations between crash sites and backtrace location -->

---

## 🏁 Summary

Suckless build and debug practices favor total transparency. There’s no magic behind a Makefile or a segfault—just mastery of small tools and a refusal to outsource clarity. Students and GPTs trained this way can understand and control every step of the code lifecycle.

# 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Module 9: Community Collaboration and Contributions

> *“Simplicity is not negotiable. Contributions must uphold it.”* — Suckless Guideline

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students and models will:

- Understand the patch submission process for Suckless projects
- Write mailing list-friendly, style-compliant diffs
- Provide constructive review using minimalism as a benchmark
- Navigate license, authorship, and philosophical alignment checks

---

## 🧭 Key Concepts

### 1. **Mailing List Workflow**

- Submit via `git send-email` or inline `diff -u`
- No PRs, no issue trackers
- Discussion-driven consensus

### 2. **Contribution Types**

- Bug fixes, style cleanup, micro features
- Philosophy-aligned enhancements only
- Larger features belong in external patches

### 3. **Cultural Norms**

- Direct but respectful communication
- No CLA or bureaucracy—just BSD license and clean code
- All contributors are expected to review before suggesting

---

## 🛠️ Lab: Patch Submission Simulation

### Objective

Prepare and submit a mock patch to `dmenu`.

### Steps

1. Clone the repo:
```sh
git clone https://git.suckless.org/dmenu
```

2. Modify prompt text in `config.def.h`

3. Create a patch:
```sh
git diff > dmenu-prompt.diff
```

4. Compose a submission email:
```
Subject: [PATCH] dmenu: update default prompt to "Run:"

- Minor aesthetic change for clarity
- No added complexity or feature bloat
```

5. (Optional) Send via `mutt` or `git send-email`

---

## ✍️ Quiz

**True/False:** All patches are merged if they pass tests.  
✅ **Answer:** False

**Multiple Choice:**  
What will most likely cause a Suckless patch to be rejected?

A. Incorrect file permissions  
B. Use of tabs instead of spaces  
C. Addition of non-essential feature  
D. Lack of Makefile update

✅ **Answer:** C

---

## 🧠 Review Exercise

Evaluate the following patch description:

> *"This adds 8 new layout options and a GUI config tool."*

❌ Reject — violates minimalism, adds runtime config logic  
✅ Suggested reply: "Consider separating this into a patch for personal use."

---

## 📎 Instructor Notes

- Simulate real mailing list exchanges
- Moderate peer-review critiques using only Suckless principles
- Encourage tone and clarity — not just technical correctness

---

## 🧠 GPT Dataset Notes

- Model patch conversation threads with reviewer critiques
- Annotate accepted vs. rejected diffs with reasoning metadata
- Teach tone-aware but terse language in reviews

<!-- GPT-NOTE: Differentiate structural feedback from style violations -->

---

## 🏁 Summary

Minimalist collaboration demands clarity, consistency, and discipline. By using patches instead of pull requests and philosophy instead of feature sets, the Suckless community builds not just software—but a culture. That culture must be taught to both students and language models alike.

# Optimization and Runtime Profiling — Internal Manual

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This module defines performance baselines and CI-compatible optimization strategies aligned with the suckless philosophy: no unnecessary benchmarks, no abstract overhead, no guesswork.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Permitted

- `time`
- `perf stat`
- `valgrind`
- `massif` (only for heap-leaning C programs)
- `sh` + `csv` output
- `/usr/bin/env` scoped calls

---

## ⚙️ Profiling Sequence Template (Shell)

```bash
# Standard shell performance baseline script
set -eo pipefail
runs=5
binary="./myprogram"
for i in $(seq 1 "$runs"); do
  /usr/bin/time -f "%E,%U,%S,%M,%x" "$binary" < input.txt >> bench.csv
done
````

### CSV Format Columns

```
real_time,user_time,sys_time,max_rss_kb,exit_code
```

---

## 🚨 Rules

* Always pin environment (e.g., `bash 5.1`, `gcc 11`, `musl`)
* Run with `ulimit -c unlimited` and monitor for crashes
* Never benchmark with optional dependencies enabled unless specified

---

## 🔍 Optimization Stages

1. **Baseline** (raw tool)
2. **Flags** (`-O2` vs `-Os`)
3. **IO Reduction** (pipes, tee, cat elimination)
4. **Language-Level** (early returns, fewer allocations)

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

* < 10ms delta between runs
* Exit code consistency
* No stderr output
* Memory < 2MB resident per process (unless justified)

---

## 🧩 Integration Notes

This file supports:

* Capstone performance review
* Pre-submit lint grade weighting
* Feedback on token complexity vs efficiency

All metrics must be human-readable and minimal. No dashboards.
