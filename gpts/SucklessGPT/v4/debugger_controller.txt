# This is a direct alias of the internal debugger.py file.
# It exists to abstract file reference and support custom GPT file count constraints.
# DO NOT modify. Canonical implementation lives in debugger.py.
# Referenced in system prompt as: “debug controller”

# ⇨ Actual contents match debugger.py (already present in this directory)
# You may copy it as:
cp debugger.py debug_controller.txt
