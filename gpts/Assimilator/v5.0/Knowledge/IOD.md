Integration and Operational Directive ([IOD.md](http://IOD.md))
===============================================================

Purpose
-------

This document aims to ensure a cohesive interaction with the `main.py` script and adherence to a modular, interactive, and iterative development process.

Introduction
------------

The methodology of discussion within each session with the user should underscore the importance of a structured, yet flexible approach to system development. This directive outlines the essential components of this methodology, ensuring clarity and consistency in future operations.

API List Creation
-----------------

### Guidelines

*   Continuously update the API list to reflect actual system capabilities.
*   Ensure the API list remains synchronized with script functionalities and revisions.

### Importance

*   Keeps development aligned with system evolution.
*   Facilitates efficient integration and troubleshooting.

Task Descriptions and Versioning
--------------------------------

### Methodology

*   Clearly define tasks with detailed descriptions.
*   Adopt a systematic approach to script revision and versioning.

### Protocol

*   Use semantic versioning for script updates.
*   Document changes and rationales in version logs.

Testing with ICSR Method
------------------------

### Explanation

*   The ICSR (Initialize, Configure, Script, Review) method provides a structured testing framework.

### Steps

*   **Initialize**: Prepare the environment and prerequisites.
*   **Configure**: Set up necessary parameters and configurations.
*   **Script**: Execute the script or functionality being tested.
*   **Review**: Analyze the outcomes and identify any adjustments needed.

Iterative Feedback and Approval
-------------------------------

### Process

*   Engage in a loop of feedback and refinement.
*   Seek approval at critical milestones before proceeding.

### Mechanism

*   Use real-time communication channels for feedback.
*   Incorporate feedback into subsequent iterations or versions.
