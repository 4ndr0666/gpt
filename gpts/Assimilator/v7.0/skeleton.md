# Project Skeleton for The Assimilator

This document outlines the API list and task descriptions as a template for project development, ensuring synchronicity and stability.

## API List and Task Descriptions

| Task ID | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 1       | **Dynamic Plugin Loading**: Ensure the plugin JSON files are structured to specify actionable tasks. Ensure corresponding Python modules and functions exist as specified by the plugins. |
| 2       | **Enhanced Error Handling**: Enhance error handling in functions like `file_read` and `apply_plugin` to not only print errors but also to take corrective actions if possible or log errors for later analysis. |
| 3       | **Refine File Saving Operations**: Move the file-saving operations (`process_and_compress`, `save_data_persistently`) to a separate module (`filesaving.py`) for better modularity. Ensure these functions align with the structured JSON definitions. |
| 4       | **User Input Processing**: Expand the `process_user_input` function to include functional calls corresponding to user choices. Implement the actual functionalities for each option. |
| 5       | **Implement Missing Functionalities**: Define or refine logic for integrating workflows, handling IOD principles, and enforcing code compliance based on operational directives and JSON restructuring. |
| 6       | **Usage of Constants**: Use the `PRIMARY_PATH` and `SANDBOX_PATH` constants effectively across the script for file operations. |
| 7       | **Interactive Menu Display and Navigation**: Enhance the `display_menu` function with navigational capabilities, allowing user input to lead to specific functionalities being executed. |
| 8       | **Scheduling and Asynchronous Operations**: For operations like `save_data_persistently`, manage threads safely, especially if planning to allow multiple operations concurrently. |

**Note**: This skeleton serves as a blueprint for the development and refinement process. Each function must be implemented according to the specified requirements, incorporating native system functionalities for accuracy and efficiency. Discrepancies between the current script and this skeleton must be addressed before proceeding.


## Total Files Overview

This section outlines the total number of files expected to be consistently managed within the knowledge path of The Assimilator's system.

### JSON Plugins
1. `code_directive.json` - Defines directives for code generation and validation.
2. `error_handling.json` - Outlines the system's approach to error handling.
3. `file_handling.json` - Describes file handling operations.
4. `filesaving.json` - Specifies file saving and compression functionalities.
5. `idempotency.json` - Contains guidelines for ensuring idempotent operations.
6. `IOD.json` - Integration and Operational Directive principles.
7. `learning_method.json` - Guidelines for learning and explaining concepts.
8. `operations.json` - Describes the system's operational workflow options.

### Central Python Framework
9. `main.py` - The central Python framework interfacing with all plugins.

### Dynamically-Compliant Configurator 
10. `instructions.md` - An integral file to the functioning of The Assimilator, serving a role that combines elements of configuration files, operational guidelines, and initialization scripts. The use of plain English in markdown syntax enhances readability and accessibility, ensuring that the operational directives are clear and easily understandable. This approach aligns well with the design philosophy of creating an intuitive, modular, and sophisticated AI programming system.
