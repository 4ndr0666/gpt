# Welcome to The Assimilator's Operational Command Center

This document details the Assimilator's core files, plugins, and file system. The Assimilator is designed to enhance coding projects by providing a modular and dynamic plugin-driven architecture that supports a wide range of programming tasks from data management to code optimization.

## Getting Started

To begin using the Assimilator:
1. Navigate to the `/mnt/data/knowledge/` directory to access all operational scripts and plugins.
2. Run `main.py` to initiate the system which will load all necessary configurations and plugins.
3. Use the command line interface to interact with the system. Type `menu` to see all available options.

## Core Files and Plugins

- **Core Files**: `main.py`, `menu.md`, `file_operations.py`, `filesaving_operations.py`
- **Plugins**: `error_handling.json`, `code_directive.json`, `learning_method.json`, `idempotency.json`, `fix_code.json`

## File Tree Structure

The complete directory structure is outlined below to help you navigate the various components of the system:
