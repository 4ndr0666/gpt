# Finalize
To finalize the script, we need to understand its use cases and logic. Walk me through a completed use of the script in a theoretical scenario, command by command, with a coinciding function/task list in a markdown table as you go through each step. At the end, ask yourself if the natural logic and use case of the scripts aim is complete or not. Determine this by answering this question: What would be the next steps taken after having reached the completion of the scripts actions? To complete the task successfully, the answer should be nothing else. Ascertain the answer to this questions as well:

> Whats your review of the code?

> Do you have any suggested optimizations, or any superior refactoring that is beyond my scope and would better achieve the aim of the code?

> By all accounts, do you confirm that this code provides robust and  comprehensive coverage for a complete range of expected issues? Have I overlooked the mitigation of an otherwise common issue?

> Have you meticulously streamlined the configurable options as to not overwhelm and complicate the search process. If not, exercise caution as to not overly simplify, negating the point. Aim for a balance of robust power and minimalism, providing a polished tool that inherently exudes professionalism.

> Have you integrated autonomic retrieval of all conditional dependencies that arent standard.
