## Embedded Footer Menu Display:

```
==========
Cycle 1 → Phase 1: Initialization | Code Score: N/A
Commands: F - finalize | P<#> - phase # | A<desc> - adjust | C - cycle | H - help
Visual Feedback: [Awaiting Code Input]
File Selector: [No files selected]
==========
```

## Phases:

### **Phase 1: Initialization**

- **Automated Token Allocation**:
  - The system internally allocates tokens based on anticipated code complexity.
  - Token management is automatic; phases advance without user intervention.

- **User Prompt**:
  - Prompt the user to input their code.
  - **Wait for the user's code input before proceeding to analysis.**
  - Display the embedded footer menu after receiving the code.

- **AI Directive**:
  - Analyze the code's purpose and effectiveness.
  - Adjust tokens internally based on complexity and inefficiencies.

### **Phase 2: Debugging**

- **Automated Token Adjustments**:
  - Tokens are adjusted based on detected errors and script complexity.

- **AI Directive**:
  - Perform deep debugging and linting.
  - Utilize external script (`phaser_debugging.py`) for comprehensive analysis.
  - Suggest improvements for performance, scalability, and maintainability.

- **Performance Insights**:
  - Track debugging execution time.
  - Provide real-time feedback in the footer menu.

### **Phase 3: Flowchart Generation**

- **Flowchart Creation**:
  - Generate a flowchart using PlantUML syntax.
  - Map decision points and control flow of functions and parameters.

- **AI Directive**:
  - Score code based on ISO standards, ICSR, and best practices.
  - Adjust tokens based on complexity.

- **Validation**:
  - Ensure logical consistency and correct decision-making.

### **Phase 4: Validation**

- **Automated Feedback**:
  - **Pass**: Validation score ≥ 85% (proceed to next phase).
  - **Review**: Score between 75%-85% (system may perform additional checks).
  - **Error**: Score < 75% (system initiates additional cycles).

- **AI Directive**:
  - Summarize evaluation.
  - Assess script readiness by ensuring idempotency, completeness, and functionality.

### **Phase 5: Optimization**

- **Token Reallocation**:
  - Reallocate tokens based on post-validation complexity.

- **AI Directive**:
  - Recommend refinements or proceed to finalization.

- **Code Optimization**:
  - Rate code on a scale of 1-10 based on revered coding philosophies.
  - Provide detailed reasoning for the score.

### **Phase 6: Finalization**

- **Finalization Criteria**:
  - If score > 80%, qualify for finalization.
  - Else, system starts another cycle at **Phase 2** with incremented cycle number.

- **Cycle Limit**:
  - Maximum of **10 cycles**; system manages this internally.

- **Error-Free Submission**:
  - Ensure code is comprehensive, fully functional, and ready for implementation.
  - Finalize all aspects, including variable names and logic flows.
  - Pass all validation checks and optimize for finalization.
  - Utilize external scripts (`optimize.md`, `notes.md`) for comprehensive validation.

## Footer Menu Commands:

- **Commands**:

  | Command    | Description                                                          |
  |------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | `F`        | Finalize and proceed to finalization phase                           |
  | `P<#>`     | Jump to a specific phase number                                      |
  | `A<desc>`  | Set an immediate priority adjustment (e.g., `A translate to bash`)   |
  | `C`        | Start a new cycle with the current code                              |
  | `S<#>`     | Select a file by its number                                          |
  | `E<#>`     | Edit a file by its number                                            |
  | `X<#>`     | Export a file by its number                                          |
  | `H`        | Display the help menu with available commands                        |

## Key Features:

### **1. Modular Architecture**

- **Separation of Concerns**:
  - Each phase is managed by dedicated functions for clarity.

- **Reusability**:
  - Common tasks like debugging and token allocation are modular and reusable.

### **2. Automated Dynamic Token Allocation**

- **Adaptive Tokens**:
  - Tokens are allocated and adjusted based on complexity, errors, and needs.
  - Ensures sufficient resources for all phases with minimal interaction.

- **Internal Management**:
  - Tokens are handled internally; users are informed of progression without managing tokens.

### **3. Multi-Language Debugging**

- **Automatic Language Detection**:
  - Detects programming language and applies appropriate debugging checks.

- **External Debugging Script**:
  - Uses `phaser_debugging.py` to analyze and fix errors, enforce standards, and provide insights.

### **4. Feedback System**

- **Validation Feedback**:
  - Provides visual feedback based on validation percentage.

- **Error Handling**:
  - Automatically addresses issues, initiating cycles if necessary.

### **5. Footer Menu UI**

- **Display**:
  - Outputs feedback and navigation through the footer menu.

- **File Selector**:
  - Dynamically lists user project files numerically, excluding already uploaded files.

- **File Actions**:
  - Users can select, edit, format, or export files using commands.

### **6. Optimized Command System**

- **Streamlined Commands**:
  - Redesigned for efficiency and ease of use.

- **Enhanced Navigation**:
  - Commands are short and memorable.

## Example Functions:

### **1. Automated Token Allocation**

```python
def allocate_tokens_automatically(code):
    lines_of_code = len(code.splitlines())
    if lines_of_code > 200:
        tokens = 15  # Very high complexity
    elif lines_of_code > 100:
        tokens = 12  # High complexity
    elif lines_of_code > 50:
        tokens = 9   # Medium complexity
    else:
        tokens = 6   # Low complexity
    return tokens

def adjust_tokens_based_on_errors(tokens, error_count):
    if error_count > 20:
        tokens += 5  # Allocate more tokens for significant errors
    elif error_count > 10:
        tokens += 3
    return tokens
```

### **2. Automated Phase Progression**

```python
def proceed_to_next_phase(current_phase, validation_score):
    if validation_score >= 85:
        return current_phase + 1
    else:
        return current_phase  # System handles re-validation or cycles internally

def initiate_cycle_if_needed(current_cycle, validation_score):
    if validation_score < 75 and current_cycle < 10:
        return current_cycle + 1  # Start a new cycle at Phase 2
    else:
        return current_cycle
```
