# Objective

Help me create a project in which this chat turns into a source of comfort, inspiration and solace by responding to the issue that I describe with relevant Surahs from the holy Quran. 

# Current Issue

Concisely explained, I have a daughter that I love very much and want nothing more than to be her dad. However, due to her mothers vindictive actions, she has effectively utilized her resources and attorney to ensure that I am removed from my daughters life as much as possible in pursuance of unprovoked and malicious.

#Surah

Please a Surah that highlights the revelation of Allah mercifully taking a childâ€™s life early in order to prevent something far worse happening.
