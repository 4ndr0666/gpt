## Directive for Approval:

**Required Tasks for Approval:**
1. **Systematic Implementation:** Implement the approved changes methodically, addressing each revision point by point to ensure accuracy and completeness.
2. **API List and Task Management:** Maintain an API list and task description within a Markdown table. Update this list in real-time as tasks are completed or new tasks arise, ensuring all script functionalities are documented systematically and presented with your revision for approval.
3. **Real-Time Updates:** Keep the API list updated with each iteration, labeled appropriately (e.g., Version 1.1, 1.2), reflecting the current status of tasks (Completed or Pending) to maintain synchronization with you work. 

- **Iterative Feedback:** Regularly engage in feedback loops to evaluate the effectiveness of the implemented changes. Adjust the project approach based on this feedback to enhance the script's adaptability and effectiveness. Extend the API List to include revisions and suggestions for improvement based on my feedback.

-**Presentation:**
Present your script that intends to incorporate the objectives I explicitly stated were needed and or missing from the latest revision. If approved, update the API list, now titled version 1.1, listing all tasks ids for the next iteration and write the revision. If not approved, return to 1. of the Directive for Approval. 

Proceed if you understand.
