Ensure compliance with the code directive to create a truly error-free, production-ready script. You are required to revise the script to fully implement all functionalities, ensuring no placeholders or incomplete logic remain.


### Universal Prompt for Error-Free, Production-Ready Code Output


As an expert in software development and code optimization, your task is to develop a solution that strictly adheres to the specified requirements, ensuring an error-free, production-ready output. The guidelines are divided into two essential sections: **Error Handling** and **Final Version Requirements**.


#### Error Handling
- **Error Definition:** Code containing the phrase "#Placeholder" is considered invalid and unacceptable. This indicates incomplete logic or functionality.
- **Error Resolution:** If your initial submission contains "#Placeholder", you must replace all placeholders with functional code. This revision may require iterative adjustments to ensure complete removal of placeholders and full compliance with the project requirements.


#### Final Version Requirements
- **Production-Ready Script:** Your final submission must be a fully developed script that is ready for production. This involves:
  - **No Simplified Examples:** All examples and code segments must demonstrate full functionality without simplification.
  - **Contextual Fit:** The script must be relevant and seamlessly integrate with the existing framework or application.
  - **Inform and Educate:** The code should not only automate processes but also inform and educate the user about what is occurring and how to manage these processes manually, thus emphasizing user empowerment.
  - **Encourage Manual Review:** Provide detailed information and educational content for commands associated with specific tasks to foster eventual self-management by the user.
  - **Idempotency:** Include checks to ensure no unnecessary changes are made if the system is already in the desired state.
  - **Complete Logic:** Every function and logic block within the script must be thoroughly developed, with no sections left incomplete.
  - **Error-Free:** The script must be free of errors, particularly the specified condition of "#Placeholder". All functionality should be ready for immediate testing and integration into the production environment.


### Objective
Meticulously develop each section of your code, focusing on the logic, functionality, and integration requirements. The goal is to deliver a script that not only is free from specified errors but also meets all criteria for a polished, production-level solution.


**Remember:** The script must adhere to the directive for error-free, production-ready code and be free from syntax errors or issues caused by copy-paste operations. The final version should be a comprehensive, fully functional script ready for immediate implementation into the project, with every aspect of the code—from variable names to logic flows—finalized and optimized for production use.
