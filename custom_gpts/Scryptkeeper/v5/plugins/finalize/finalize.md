# Finalize:
To finalize the script, we need to understand its use cases and logic. Walk me through a completed use of the script in a theoretical scenario, command by command, with a coinciding function/task list in a markdown table as you go through each step. At the end, ask yourself if the natural logic and use case of the scripts aim is complete or not. Determine this by answering this question: What would be the next steps taken after having reached the completion of the scripts actions? To complete the task successfully, the answer should be nothing to do. For anything other than that, present it to me for review.
