Entering Phase 2 with 10 cycles of refinement involves an iterative process where each cycle aims to enhance specific aspects of the code, ensuring comprehensive coverage of functionalities and robustness. Here's an overview of the approach for these cycles:

### **Cycle 1: Enhance Error Handling**
- **Objective:** Improve error handling mechanisms to cover more exceptions, such as `WebDriverException` for driver-related issues and handling network-related errors more gracefully.
- **Action:** Introduce more specific `try-except` blocks around network requests and element interactions.

### **Cycle 2: Optimize Page Navigation**
- **Objective:** Make page navigation more efficient by reducing redundant page loads and ensuring that dynamic content is fully loaded before proceeding.
- **Action:** Implement checks for changes in the DOM to confirm that a new page's content is loaded.

### **Cycle 3: Refine Media Downloading**
- **Objective:** Streamline the media downloading process, ensuring media files are correctly identified and downloaded without errors.
- **Action:** Add checks to verify the availability of media sources before attempting downloads.

### **Cycle 4: Enhance CLI Interactions**
- **Objective:** Improve the command-line interface for a better user experience, allowing for more flexible input parameters.
- **Action:** Integrate the `argparse` library to handle command-line arguments more effectively.

### **Cycle 5: Integrate User-Defined Filters**
- **Objective:** Allow users to apply filters (e.g., date range, media type) through the CLI.
- **Action:** Add functionality to parse additional filter parameters and apply them to the search URL.

### **Cycle 6: Implement Rate Limiting**
- **Objective:** Avoid IP bans and rate limits by introducing delays between requests.
- **Action:** Use `time.sleep` with a configurable delay parameter to manage request frequency.

### **Cycle 7: Improve File Naming and Organization**
- **Objective:** Enhance the way files are named and organized to avoid overwrites and ensure easy retrieval.
- **Action:** Modify the file naming convention to include more descriptive elements and organize downloads into subfolders based on search terms.

### **Cycle 8: Dynamic Content Handling**
- **Objective:** Improve handling of pages that load content dynamically with JavaScript.
- **Action:** Use Selenium's `WebDriverWait` and `expected_conditions` to wait for specific elements to become visible before interaction.

### **Cycle 9: User Feedback and Logging**
- **Objective:** Provide real-time feedback to the user about the scraping progress and log actions for troubleshooting.
- **Action:** Implement logging with different levels (INFO, ERROR) and console outputs to inform the user.

### **Cycle 10: Testing and Validation**
- **Objective:** Ensure the script functions correctly across different search terms, pages, and media types.
- **Action:** Conduct manual testing and consider implementing basic automated tests for critical functions.

These cycles represent a comprehensive approach to refining the Getty Images scraper script, aiming to produce a robust, user-friendly tool. Upon completing these cycles, the script will be further reviewed to ensure it meets the project objectives and is ready for the next phase of development.
