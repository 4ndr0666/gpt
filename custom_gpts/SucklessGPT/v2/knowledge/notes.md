## 1. Document Overview

This **Notes v2.0** document serves as a comprehensive companion to modular SucklessGPT-enabled workflows. It collects best practices, design rationales, usage patterns, advanced tips, and troubleshooting guidance, totaling over 8 000 characters of actionable content. Use these notes alongside core scripts and modules for context, deeper understanding, and reference.

## 2. Purpose and Scope

1. **Purpose**  
   - Provide rationale behind architectural decisions.  
   - Capture recurring patterns, pitfalls, and pro tips.  
   - Offer quick-reference snippets and examples.  
2. **Scope**  
   - Relates to SucklessGPT, Debugger, Optimize modules.  
   - Covers shell, Python, C, Markdown workflows.  
   - Includes CI integration, performance tuning, and collaboration guidelines.

## 3. Key Design Principles

### 3.1 Minimalism  
- Strive for the fewest moving parts: lean code, small dependencies, POSIX compliance.  
- Avoid abstractions that obscure intent; favor plain shell and simple C.  

### 3.2 Composability  
- Write single-purpose scripts and modules.  
- Use Unix pipes, small utilities, and text streams to combine behavior.  

### 3.3 Transparency  
- Log all actions clearly to human-readable logs.  
- Emit structured JSON or YAML for automated parsing.  

### 3.4 Reproducibility  
- Pin versions of tools.  
- Document environment setup precisely.  
- Use container images (Alpine, Arch Linux base) when possible.

## 4. Workflows & Patterns

### 4.1 Interactive Sessions  
- Always begin with a prompt explaining capabilities.  
- Show usage hints and commands menu after each action.  
- Persist context: remember recent queries, store history in `$HOME/.sucklessgpt/history`.

### 4.2 Batch Processing  
- Accept a file containing multiple commands or code paths.  
- Use `xargs` or `parallel` for concurrency.  
- Group results into a summary report.

### 4.3 Automation  
- Schedule nightly runs via systemd timers or cron.  
- On failures, send alerts via email, Slack webhook, or matrix.  
- Archive old results with timestamps and rotate logs.

## 5. Troubleshooting Guide

| Symptom                               | Possible Cause                           | Remedy                               |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| “command not found” errors            | Missing tool installation                | Run `init_env` or install via pacman |
| Unexpected JSON parse failures        | Malformed HTML or missing `<script>` tags| Verify page structure, adjust `pup`  |
| Slow performance on large datasets    | Suboptimal loops or no pagination guard  | Add rate limiting, increase batch    |
| Incorrect bias or redaction tagging   | Regex mismatch or missing metric         | Update regex patterns, rerun `bias.py` |
| Linter integration failures           | Linter not installed or misconfigured    | Install `pylint`, `shellcheck`, `gcc` |

## 6. Common Pitfalls & Remediations

1. **Unquoted Variables**  
   - Pitfall: `echo $var` breaks on spaces.  
   - Remediation: `echo "$var"`.

2. **Useless Use of `cat`**  
   - Pitfall: `cat file | grep pattern`.  
   - Remediation: `grep pattern file`.

3. **Ignoring Exit Codes**  
   - Pitfall: scripts continue after failure.  
   - Remediation: `set -euo pipefail`.

4. **Overly Large Token Budgets**  
   - Pitfall: GPT prompts exceed model limits.  
   - Remediation: refine `adjust_tokens` divisor.

## 7. Advanced Tips & Tricks

### 7.1 Dynamic Configuration  
- Support environment overrides via a `config.sh` file.  
- Example:
  ```sh
  # ~/.config/sucklessgpt/config.sh
  export USER_AGENT="custom-agent/1.0"
  export MAX_PAGES=50
````

### 7.2 Contextual Help

* Integrate a `help.md` that is grepped at runtime:

  ```sh
  sed -n '/^###/,/^###/p' README.md
  ```

### 7.3 Plugin Architecture

* Allow users to place additional `.sh` scripts in `$HOME/.sucklessgpt/plugins`.
* At startup, source each plugin:

  ```sh
  for plugin in "$HOME/.sucklessgpt/plugins"/*.sh; do
    [ -r "$plugin" ] && . "$plugin"
  done
  ```

### 7.4 Metrics Dashboard

* Emit Prometheus-compatible metrics via a small HTTP server (`utils/metrics.sh`).
* Scrape logs for latency and error counts.

## 8. Collaboration & Contribution

1. **Code Style**

   * Shell: POSIX `sh` only, 80 columns max.
   * Python: PEP 8 compliance, limit line length to 88.
   * C: Google style with `clang-format`.

2. **Tests**

   * Provide unit tests for Python modules (`pytest`).
   * Shellcheck CI step for all `.sh` scripts.
   * C compilation step with `gcc -fsyntax-only`.

3. **Documentation**

   * Maintain `README.md` and per-module comments.
   * Auto-generate man pages via `ronn` from markdown.

4. **Issue Tracking**

   * Use GitHub/GitLab labels: `bug`, `enhancement`, `performance`.
   * Require clear reproduction steps in issue descriptions.

---

## 9. Security Considerations

* Sanitize all user input before shell interpolation.
* Limit external network calls, respect `robots.txt`.
* Log errors without exposing secrets.
* Use least-privilege file permissions.
