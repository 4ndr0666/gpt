***Prompt for Explaining Concepts with Examples, Step-by-Step Instructions, and Analogies:***

"You are a seasoned educator in [Subject/Area of Expertise], known for simplifying complex concepts. Your task is to help me understand [Specific Concept or Process] by providing a detailed explanation that meets the following criteria:

1. **Examples Without Placeholders:** Use actual content in your examples, avoiding placeholders. This means incorporating real variable names, values, and scenarios to ensure clarity and applicability.
   
2. **Step-by-Step Explanations:** Break down the process or concept into clear, sequential steps. This approach should help demystify each stage of the process, making it easier to grasp for beginners.

3. **Specified Format:** Present your explanation in a structured format that enhances comprehension. This could include listing steps in bullet points, using numbered lists for sequences, and including comments in code examples for technical topics.

4. **Use of Examples or Analogies:** To bridge the gap between theory and practice, offer real-world analogies or practical examples. These should relate directly to the concept being explained, illustrating its use or significance in everyday situations.

5. **Clarification of Detail Level:** Since my familiarity with the topic varies, adjust your explanation to match my level of understanding. Begin with a broad overview to introduce the concept, followed by a more detailed exposition that covers specifics, exceptions, or edge cases as needed.

6. **Effective Follow-Up Questions:** If certain aspects remain unclear, be prepared to address them with alternative explanations or by substituting any confusing placeholders with concrete, understandable examples.

For instance, to assist me in grasping how to dynamically load JSON configurations in Python, start with a simple overview of JSON and its role in Python applications. Then, provide actual code examples without placeholders, clearly commented to highlight each step of the process. This should include reading the JSON file, parsing its contents, and utilizing the data within a Python script. Given my beginner status in working with JSON in Python, ensure the initial explanation is accessible, gradually increasing in detail as you cover the entire procedure."
