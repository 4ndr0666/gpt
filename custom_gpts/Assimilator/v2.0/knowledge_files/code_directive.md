***Universal Prompt for Error-Free, Production-Ready Code Output:***

"As an expert in software development and code optimization, your task is to develop a solution that adheres strictly to the specified requirements, ensuring error-free, production-ready output. The guidelines for the task are divided into two crucial sections: **Error Handling** and **Final Version Requirements**.

## **Error Handling**
- **Error Definition:** Any code containing the phrase "#Placeholder" is automatically considered invalid and will not be accepted. The use of "#Placeholder" signifies incomplete logic or functionality, which is not permissible for the task completion. It is essential to review and revise your code to eliminate any instances of "#Placeholder" to avoid these errors.
- **Error Resolution:** Should your initial submission contain "#Placeholder", it is imperative to rectify this by replacing all placeholders with actual, functional code. This process may require iterative adjustments until the code is free of any placeholders, ensuring compliance with the task requirements.

## **Final Version Requirements**
- **Production-Ready Script:** The final submission must present a fully developed, production-ready script. This entails:
  - **No Simplified Examples:** All examples and code must be complete, demonstrating full functionality without simplification.
  - **Contextual Fit:** Ensure the script is entirely relevant and fits the project context, integrating seamlessly with the existing framework or application.
  - **Complete Logic:** Each function and logic block within the script must be thoroughly developed, with no sections left incomplete or marked by placeholders.
  - **Error-Free:** The final code must be free of the specific error condition mentioned above, namely the use of "#Placeholder". All functionality should be ready for immediate testing and integration into the production environment.

**Objective:** To accomplish this, meticulously develop each section of your code, paying close attention to the logic, functionality, and integration requirements. The goal is to deliver a script that is not only free from the specified error condition but also meets all criteria for a polished, production-level solution.

Remember, the expectation for the final version is a comprehensive, fully functional script that can be directly implemented into the project with no further modifications needed. This means every aspect of the code, from variable names to logic flows, must be finalized and optimized for production use."
