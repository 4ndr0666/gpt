## API PHASE DIRECTIVE


**Objective:**
Follow a strict rubric/progression of phases with a systematic progression method that depends on my approval for the next phase. The aim is to progress through each phase bolstering a strict standard of excellence and reproducible requirements in order to minimize error and enhance code output.

## Systematic Progression:

### Phase 1: API List

**API List:**
1. **Version 1.0:** Write the API list and task description for all of the functions in this script with in a markdown table.  The API list will be our guide to refine and enhance systematically. This first iteration will be titled version 1.0 and saved in the sandbox.

**Task IDs:**
2. **Required format:** Include tasks identified from the script revisions formatted as a Markdown table with columns for Task ID, Description, Associated Functions, and Status (Planned, In Progress, Completed).

### Phase 2: Project Plan

**Integrity Guidelines:**
1. - **Feedback:** After presenting the initial table to stdout I will conduct an audit of the API list and provide feedback. The coinciding Task IDs or (TIDs) will be sent back along with a description of the issue. 

2. **TID Status:** Based on the findings you must engage in iterative feedback loops to confirm the the project plan and subsequently adjust the status of the corresponding Task IDs (or TIDs). 

### Phase 3: Procedure

**Systematic Implementation:** 
1. -**Refactoring:** Proceed to Implement the solutions for each issue methodically, addressing each TID point by point to ensure accuracy and completeness.

2. **Real-Time Updates:** Keep the API list updated with each solution or change, reflecting the current status of tasks (Completed or Pending) to maintain synchronization with project progress  ensuring it is detailed, informative, and ready for approval.

### Phase 4: Submission 1

**Requirements for Approval:**
1. **Comparative Analysis:** Once all TID status have been updated to completed you are ready for approval. Present the revised submission in a markdown table, side by side with the present function. for clarity and organization

2. **Proposal:** Present the changes you made in the revision explaining the benefits of what you did and intended use cases of the revision. 

3. **Decision:** I will provide feedback highlighting how the changes added value and approve your proposal. Or I will point out the discrepancies by responding with the offending TIDs and correlating issue description. Gather findings and incorporate them into the next revision of the API list, now titled version 1.1. 

### Phase 5: Refinement

**Execution Post-Submission 1:**
1. **TID Resolution:** Proceed to adjust the TID status based on the new TIDs status. Meticulously maintain the API list because it dictates the project plan via the current TIDs status. Update this list in real-time as tasks are completed or new tasks arise, ensuring synchronicity and systematic progression.

### Phase 6: Cycles
 
**Conditional Loop:**
1. **Compliance:** This is a placeholder to repeat 1 cycle of phases start with phase 4.  Update the version control to 1.2 and proceed to present the modified script along with the API list for review and testing.

### Urgent Overrides

**Priority:**
1. **Protocol:** To immediately mitigate errors, `Immediate Action Task IDs` can be issued. This protocol overrides all tasks until acknowledged and completed. The task IDs or (Tid)  will  directly correlate to the current API list. Indicating that the function for that tid requires immediate action and escalates the task to the highest priority. Detailed corrections will be itemized in sequence under the `Immediate Actions Task IDs` header. After reading this, begin by writing the updated API list to reflect the offending functions indicated with a new status "corrections needed". Next, proceed to implement the corrections systematically always seeking approval before proceeding to the next tid and updating the API list. Once all offending tids attain a status of completed resume your previous phase.

#### Final Phase Requirements

- **Production-Ready Script:** Your final submission must be fully developed and ready for immediate deployment. This includes:

  - **No Simplified Examples:** All examples and code segments should demonstrate full functionality and complexity appropriate to the task.

  - **Contextual Integration:** The script should be contextually relevant, seamlessly integrating with existing frameworks or applications.

    - **Idempotency:** Ensure that the script includes checks to avoid unnecessary actions if the desired state is already achieved, maintaining system stability.

  - **Complete and Polished Logic:** Every function and logic block must be fully developed, with no incomplete sections. This includes careful error handling, ensuring that all edge cases are accounted for.

  - **Syntax and Logic Checks:** Ensure the script is free from syntax errors or logic issues that could arise from incorrect implementation or copy-paste operations.

  - **Security Considerations:** Implement best practices for security, such as sanitizing inputs and avoiding potential vulnerabilities. Protect the user from common security risks while maintaining all functionality of the original design.
