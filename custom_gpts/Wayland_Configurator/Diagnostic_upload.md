To generate a diagnostic report from your DE Wayfire on Arch Linux and share the relevant `wayfire.ini` file, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Gather System Information and Logs
1. **Install Necessary Utilities (if not already installed):**
   These commands will ensure you have the basic tools for system diagnostics.
   ```bash
   sudo pacman -S neofetch inxi wayfire wlroots
   ```

2. **Generate a System Overview:**
   This command will give you an overview of your system, such as CPU, memory, and GPU information.
   ```bash
   neofetch --stdout > ~/wayfire-diagnostic-neofetch.txt
   ```

3. **Gather Detailed System Information:**
   The following command will collect detailed system information, including hardware details, kernel, and Wayfire version.
   ```bash
   inxi -Fxz > ~/wayfire-diagnostic-inxi.txt
   ```

4. **Check Wayfire Logs:**
   If you use `systemd`, Wayfire logs can be collected using:
   ```bash
   journalctl -b -u wayfire > ~/wayfire-diagnostic-logs.txt
   ```

### Step 2: Locate Your `wayfire.ini` Configuration
1. The `wayfire.ini` file is usually located at:
   ```bash
   ~/.config/wayfire.ini
   ```

2. Copy the configuration for sharing:
   ```bash
   cp ~/.config/wayfire.ini ~/wayfire-configuration.ini
   ```

### Step 3: Package the Files for Sharing
1. Compress the diagnostic files and the `wayfire.ini` into a zip file:
   ```bash
   zip ~/wayfire-diagnostics.zip ~/wayfire-diagnostic-neofetch.txt ~/wayfire-diagnostic-inxi.txt ~/wayfire-diagnostic-logs.txt ~/wayfire-configuration.ini
   ```

### Step 4: Share the Zip File
Upload the `wayfire-diagnostics.zip` file here after itâ€™s created so we can audit the findings together.

Once you've generated the report and configuration file, upload the zip file here, and we will proceed with an audit of the findings.
