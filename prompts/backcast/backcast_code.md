Perform a backcasting analysis of your revision:

 **Backcasting Analysis:**

Conduct a backcasting analysis to create a strategic plan for achieving my desired final script. Please follow these steps:

1. **Define the Desired Final Script:** Help me articulate a clear and specific vision of the final script I want to create, including objectives and outcomes I seek. Here is a rough writing of my final script I would like to achieve:  
   **A script is for merging multiple video clips together to create a single high quality video. In that task many issues may arise causing complications such as, resolution, frame rate, codec, aspect ration, etc. The goal of this script is to automatically mitigate the required workflow to solve those conflicts ensuring appropriate merging of any video clip selected even if they do not conventially go together. The script needs to intelligently identify these potential conflicts and issues while devising a mitigation method in alignment with the end goal.**  
2. **Current State Analysis:** Assess the current state of the revision, highlighting existing conditions and challenges relevant to my final script. This is the revision:
   
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
```
  
3. **Milestone Development:** Identify key milestones along the timeline between the present and the final script.  
4. **Work Backwards to Create Pathways:** Your job is to work backwards from the final script to the present before developing a plan, detailing the actions, strategies, and resources needed to reach each milestone.   
5. **Identify Necessary Conditions:** In my action plan you are to give me conditions that must be met to ensure progression toward each milestone and the final script.  
6. **Strategic Action Plan:** After you run through all of these steps create a comprehensive action plan that starts from the present, including initiatives that align with the necessary conditions and milestones. 

Run through this process before giving me the final script.
