**Objective**: Perform a thorough analysis of [ the function to merge video files ], focusing on its effectiveness, potential improvements, coding best practices, and rating the function or task execution against industry standards. The goal is to produce a detailed, constructive evaluation that can guide further development.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the [Functions’s] Purpose and Analyze Its Effectiveness**

**Prompt**: 
- "Analyze [the functio]n and identify its primary method of implementation. What is it designed to accomplish? Based on its implementation, how effectively does it achieve that purpose? Are there areas where it might fall short, or does it address the target goals comprehensively?"

---

### **Step 2: Alternative Approach – How Would You Write It?**

**Prompt**:
- "If you were to rewrite [this functio]n with the goal of [achieving the highest quality video file possible from merging multiple video files from the complete range of possible video file extensions, sizes, aspect-ratios and frame-rates], how would you approach the problem? What changes would you make in terms of structure, design, or logic to improve performance, scalability, and maintainability?"

---

### **Step 3: Rate the [Function] or Task Execution Using Advanced Coding Philosophies**

**Prompt**:
- "Based on revered coding philosophies and methods such as **versatility**, **error handling**, **performance optimization**, **intelligence**, and **logic**, rate [this function] on a scale from 1 to 10. A score of 10 represents a [function] that is dynamic, intelligent, optimized and ready for production-level distribution. Provide reasoning for the rating you assign and describe the criteria you used."

---

### **Step 4: Summarize the Evaluation**

**Prompt**:
- "Summarize the analysis by addressing the following:
  1. Does [the function] meet its intended purpose of [producing a single video file in the highest possible quality from merging various video files types of all possible parameters]?
  2. How could [the function] be improved based on coding best practices?
  3. How does it compare to industry standards in terms of intelligence, versatility, and end result?"

---

### **Step 5: Recommendation on Next Steps**

**Prompt**:
- "Based on the overall evaluation, what should we do next to ensure [this function] scores a 10? Would it benefit from further intelligence, idempotency, modularity, and optimization (Refactor loop), or is it ready for production as it is?"

---

### **Directive Summary**:
- This set of prompts guides you through a detailed, multi-layered evaluation of [the video merging function], starting with a basic understanding of its purpose, followed by a comparison with ideal approaches, and finally, a rating based on advanced coding standards.

Awesome! I am in complete agreement with the future milestones. Dedicate these to memory as we continue the project. However, right now I want to take a look back at the initial backcasting analysis for clarification and adjustments. Please follow along:

# Intelligent Automation Alignment

Lets take a look back and refer to the inital backcasting analysis you performed, more specifically the "Current State Analysis" and "Milestone Development" sections. I want to clarify and validate specific functionalities in order to enforce alignment with the final script. Let me highlight the initial problems you found and our approach to mitigate those shortcomings and we will go from there:

**Weaknesses**:
   - Limited Intelligence: Relies heavily on user input without automatic detection of input video properties.
   - User Experience: Interactive prompts are useful but can be streamlined for efficiency, especially in automated workflows.

**Milestones**:
   3. Implement automatic detection and adaptation to input video properties (resolution, frame rate, codec).

Fast forward to the current revision of the script we have now and through providing multiple resources to raise contextual awareness I declare that we are mostly there but the script still misses the mark described by these two areas. In other words, the script in its current state **still** heavily relies on user input, maybe even more so now. The resolution for this was intended to be automated workflows leveraging automatic detection and adaptation to input video properties. This is exactly why I compiled all of the information I did and shared it with you. You have done an incredible job of refining and integrating the information into the current script but you have overlooked the central design and purpose of the script in the first place, which you yourself described in the above weaknesses and milestones. 


Consider the following breakdown before refactoring:

**Thought Points:**

-   **Setup and Configuration**: Review the entire script thoroughly to understand its structure and functionality. Identify the required setup and configuration and functions or options that are not operational or have errors. Examine the integration of any  logging,  necessary directories, constants and definitions. Then think about the best way to implement the new functionalities in a cohesive manner without breaking the current setup and config. Leverage and rely on the new insight gained from the provided documentation.

-   **Dependency Management**: Inspect for and ensure autonomic installation of all required dependencies/packages as needed by the script. For this particular setup, focus on Pacman and Yay.

-   **Command Execution Helper**: Analyze and inspect for a the necessity of a function to execute system commands and handle outputs gracefully. Ensure the new code aligns with this as well.

-   **Menu System**: Analyze the current implementation of the cli menu. Ensure a robust command-line menu with clear options for each function for user interactions. Creatively meld simplicity with a dash of elegance by staying in the text-based interface and use text styling and layout to enhance visual appeal and clarity. If using a **gui**, ensure a robust menu system with clear options for each function providing visual feedback on the status of operations. Find a balance between minimalism and a visually engaging user experience with sophisticated visuals.  

**Objectives:**

1.  **Analyze the Existing Code:**
Before implementation, think about how you will modify the script to align with the automation details discussed. Carefully review the potential new functions/definitions/logic with a focus on not breaking the current codebase. Pay specific attention as to not omit any current functions either as this is usually the case during a refactoring. 

2.  **Developing Primed Solutions:** 
Assure this by writing the API list and task description for all of the tasks in the current script with in a markdown table. Then write another API list and task description for all of the tasks in the new code to be added with in a markdown table. Perform a comparative analysis of the two ensuring the original number of functions from the existing code aligns with the new number of functions from the proposed revision.

3. **Cohesion Loop:** 
For each non-operational function or function that doesnt align with the discussed requirements, devise 3 solutions to fix the identified problems. When providing, think about why you selected each one and list 3 components or factors that went into choosing that solution.
Evaluate each solutions success probability considering execution difficulty, outcome, problem scope, and impact. Give each solution a success probability measured by percentages of 1%-100% along with the reasoning on how you arrived at that score. Remove the two lowest ranking solutions and write a condensed summary of the highest ranking solution along with its probability of success. Ensure that any required logs or data files are correctly generated and utilized by the functions that need them.
   - Initiate a loop and run through the loop three times.
   - Develop 3 more solutions that could potentially have better results than the first highest ranking solution.
   - Provide 3 components that went into the 2 new solutions and include the current highest ranking solution within that list for a total of 3 solutions.
   - Forego the probability evaluation for now.

4. **Implementation:**
Repeat a loop with (steps 2-3) 3 more times before arriving at a final solution. Modify the code to implement the solutions you've developed. Update functions to ensure alignment in logic and command usage. Ensure proper interaction between different parts of the script because of the changes being made. Ensure that dependencies are correctly handled and that any necessary resources are available when the script runs. Improve error handling and input validation to prevent immediate failures and handle unexpected inputs gracefully. Perform thorough testing of all modified functions to ensure they work as intended. Simulate user interactions and inputs to test interactive prompts and default behaviors. Address any bugs or issues discovered during testing.

5. **Review and Fix Additional Issues:**
After implementation, think about the required integration and the necessary steps to ensure cohesion in the workflow and logic. Assure this by using PlantUML syntax to create the flow chart with copy code output and confirm the decision-making is logical and correct. 

6.  **Enhance Code Quality:**
Then from the comprehensive list of functions and their respective parameters review this program, include code review part and suggestions for improvement part. Next, implement the new functionalities and all suggestions for improvement cohesively and idempotently into the existing script and ensure that it integrates seamlessly with the other existing functionalities.

7.  **Finalize and Present Revision:**
Ensure that every aspect of the code—from variable names to logic flows—is finalized with no placeholders or omitted lines. Verify that the script is fully functional, error-free, and production-ready. Prepare the code for immediate testing, ensuring that there are no syntax errors or issues caused by copy-paste operations. Write the optimized code directly in your response, ensuring it is comprehensive and fully functional. Ensure that the code is formatted correctly and free from any syntax errors. The code should be ready for immediate testing as the next step.

**Important Notes:**

- Do not include any placeholders or omit any lines of code.
- Ensure that all of the resources I shared with you are being integrated and dictating your refactoring.
- Use consistent coding standards and best practices throughout the script.
- Handle unexpected inputs and scenarios gracefully, providing meaningful error messages or default behaviors.
