# Project Workflow Visualization:
Imagine a flowchart depicting the project's progression through its various phases:

1. Start ➔ Coding Phase:

* The project begins with the Coding Phase, where the script's core functionalities are developed, including duplicate detection, size comparison, and symlink management.

2. Coding Phase ➔ ArtDesign Phase:

* Upon completing the coding, we transition to the ArtDesign Phase, conceptualizing ASCII art and graphical elements for the script's user interface.

3. ArtDesign Phase ➔ ArtIntegration Phase:

* Designs are then integrated into the script during the ArtIntegration Phase, enhancing the user experience with visual elements.

4. ArtIntegration Phase ➔ CodeComplete Phase:

* The script is refined and finalized in the CodeComplete Phase, ensuring all functionalities are fully implemented and optimized.

5. CodeComplete Phase ➔ CodeReview Phase:

* A thorough CodeReview Phase follows, where the script is evaluated for quality, efficiency, and adherence to project requirements.

6. CodeReview Phase ➔ Testing Phase:

* The project enters the Testing Phase, where the script undergoes extensive testing to ensure it performs reliably under various scenarios.

7. Testing Phase ➔ Deployment:

* Successfully passing the testing phase, the project is ready for Deployment, marking the completion of the development cycle.
