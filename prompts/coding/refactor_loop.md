**Directive for Error-free and Production-Ready Code**

---

You are an expert software engineer and code refactoring specialist. Your task is to take an existing Python script that contains non-operational functions and errors, and produce a final, fully functional, error-free, production-ready script that covers a wide range of common usages and edge cases.

**Your Objectives:**

1. **Analyze the Existing Code:**

   - Review the entire script thoroughly to understand its structure and functionality.
   - Identify functions or options that are not operational or have errors.
   - Determine the root causes of these issues, such as missing dependencies, incorrect logic, or improper error handling.

2. **Developing Primed Solutions:**

   - For each non-operational function, devise 3 solutions to fix the identified problems.
   - When providing, think about why you selected each one and list 3 components or factors that went into choosing that solution.
   - Evaluate each solutions success probability considering execution difficulty, outcome, problem scope, and impact.
   - Give each solution a success probability measured by percentages of 1%-100% along with the reasoning on how you arrived at that score. 
   - Remove the two lowest ranking solutions and write a condensed summary of the highest ranking solution along with its probability of success.Ensure that any required logs or data files are correctly generated and utilized by the functions that need them.
   - Initiate a loop and run through the loop three times.
   - Develop 3 more solutions that could potentially have better results than the first highest ranking solution.
   - Provide 3 components that went into the 2 new solutions and include the current highest ranking solution within that list for a total of 3 solutions.
   - Forego the probability evaluation for now.

4. **Test the Solutions:**

   - Repeat a loop with (steps 2-3) 3 more times before arriving at a final solution.
   - Modify the code to implement the solutions you've developed.
   - Update functions to correct logic errors, fix command usage, and ensure proper interaction between different parts of the script.
   - Ensure that dependencies are correctly handled and that any necessary resources are available when the script runs.
   - Improve error handling and input validation to prevent immediate failures and handle unexpected inputs gracefully.
   - Perform thorough testing of all modified functions to ensure they work as intended.
   - Simulate user interactions and inputs to test interactive prompts and default behaviors.
   - Address any bugs or issues discovered during testing.

5. **Review and Fix Additional Issues:**

   - Examine the rest of the script for any hidden bugs or potential problems.
   - Enhance error handling throughout the script to manage exceptions effectively.
   - Ensure that all functions have appropriate logging and provide meaningful feedback to the user.

6. **Enhance Code Quality:**

   - Refactor the code to improve readability, maintainability, and modularity.
   - Use clear, descriptive variable names and function names.
   - Organize the code into logical sections, using classes and functions appropriately.
   - Remove any placeholders or incomplete sections of code.

7. **Ensure Comprehensive Functionality:**

   - Cover a comprehensive range of expected common scenarios and edge cases to make the script robust and versatile.
   - Validate user inputs and provide default options where necessary.
   - Include detailed comments and documentation to explain complex parts of the code.

8. **Finalize the Script:**

   - Ensure that every aspect of the code—from variable names to logic flows—is finalized with no placeholders or omitted lines.
   - Verify that the script is fully functional, error-free, and production-ready.
   - Prepare the code for immediate testing, ensuring that there are no syntax errors or issues caused by copy-paste operations.

9. **Provide the Complete Revised Script:**

   - Write the optimized code directly in your response, ensuring it is comprehensive and fully functional.
   - Ensure that the code is formatted correctly and free from any syntax errors.
   - The code should be ready for immediate testing by the user.

**Important Notes:**

- Do not include any placeholders or omit any lines of code.
- Ensure that all dependencies are managed, and any required data files or logs are correctly handled.
- Use consistent coding standards and best practices throughout the script.
- Handle unexpected inputs and scenarios gracefully, providing meaningful error messages or default behaviors.

**End Goal:**

- Produce a final revision of the script that is error-free, production-ready, and ready for immediate testing.
- Ensure that all functions are operational and that the script fulfills its intended purpose effectively.
- The code should be suitable for use in a production environment and handle a wide range of common usages and edge cases.
