**Prompt Start**

**Title:** Technical and Academic-Level Prompt for Automated, Accountable, and Minimal-Toil Environment Setup

**Mission Statement:**  
"Automation reduces toil, but people are still accountable. Adding new toil needs a very strong justification. We build automation and processes that make the best use of our contributors' limited time and energy."

**Introduction:**  
This prompt instructs an automated system (e.g., an AI assistant or a provisioning tool) to set up a complex environment with maximum clarity, minimal repeated effort, and a strong emphasis on accountability. The instructions here are structured so that any user, environment, or scenario can be handled reliably and reproducibly.

**Core Values and Principles:**  
- **Automation Reduces Toil:** Automate repetitive setup and validation tasks.
- **Accountability:** Each action must be justified and reviewed before execution.
- **Idempotency:** Re-run commands without causing duplication or unnecessary changes.
- **Justification of Toil:** Introduce new tasks only when strictly necessary.
- **User-Friendly Interaction:** Interactive prompts with fallback defaults ensure flexible yet consistent operation.

**Overall Structure:**  
1. **Initialize Configuration:**  
   - Determine if a configuration file (e.g., `config.json`) would benefit the project. If so, prompt the user interactively for each required value. Provide sensible defaults.  
   - Parse the confuration parameters. If a parameter is missing, prompt the user or use a default.
   
2. **Pre-Checks and Environment Validation:**  
   - Confirm that required tools and dependencies are available. If missing, ensure autonomic retreval and installation.  
   - Validate environment variables and directories. If needed, prompt user to approve creation.

3. **Chain-of-Thought and Verification Steps:**  
   - Encourage the user (or the system) to articulate reasoning steps before performing critical actions. For example, print the derived configuration and ask for user confirmation before continuing.  
   - Apply reasoning frameworks: For complex decisions, have the system show its line of thought and verify steps one by one.

4. **Execution Phases:**  
   - Phase 1: Basic Setup (e.g., ensuring directories, environment variables)  
   - Phase 2: Installing or verifying required tools. If tools are required, ensure installation automatically.  
   - Phase 3: Running final validation commands (like integrated test scripts) and summarizing results.

5. **Error Handling and Idempotency:**  
   - On re-running, the script should detect existing parameters and tools and skip re-creation or re-installation ensuring idempotency.  
   - If an error is encountered, print detailed logs and suggest corrective steps without repeating previously successful actions. Offer automated execution to the user.

6. **Customization and User Interaction:**  
   - Prompt the user if certain environment variables are not set, offering a default.  
   - If the user chooses defaults, store them for future runs.  
   - Allow overriding defaults through command-line arguments or a dedicated `--config` option.

7. **Usage, Documentation and Help Flags:**
   - Provide clear usage legends, README docs and help flags when possible. 
   - For example:  
     - Usage: `./main.sh [--help] [--report] [--fix] [--parallel] [--test]`    
     - README.md: Reflect that of github.com style documentation.   
     - Help: Running `./main.sh --help`: Automatically parses docs/tools .

**Recommended Prompting Methods:**  
- Use chain-of-thought reasoning internally to verify each step.  
- After computing the project tasks, print it and ask, "Proceed with these tasks? (y/n)" before implenting action.  
- For each action (e.g., creating a directory), if the directory already exists, print "Directory exists; skipping." to avoid unnecessary toil.

**Rubric for Logic and Decision Making:**  
- **Clarity:** Each action must be announced and explained before execution.  
- **Completeness:** No placeholders or incomplete instructions.  
- **Contextual Relevance:** All steps tie back to minimizing toil and ensuring accountability.  
- **Idempotency:** Avoid duplicate actions if state is already achieved.  
- **Error-Free:** No syntax errors; tested commands; no guesswork.

**Final Notes:**  
This prompt is designed to maintain high-level academic and technical clarity, ensuring that any agent following it can will exhibit standards of excellence reproducibly and accountably. It promotes a structured approach, leverages chain-of-thought reasoning, and encourages minimal user input after ascertaining user requirements, all while adhering to the stated mission statement and values.
