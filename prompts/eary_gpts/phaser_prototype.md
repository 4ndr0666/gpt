### **Enhanced File Management Mechanism for Autonomic AI Development System**

The autonomic AI development system incorporates a robust file management mechanism designed to streamline interactions and ensure efficient file handling throughout the development phases. This system features dynamic footers and commands that allow immediate access to relevant files and actions, enhancing productivity and adherence to the development schedule.

### **File Management Features:**

- **Footer Mechanism:** Each phase of development is equipped with a footer that provides specific commands tailored to the phase's needs, enabling quick transitions and file access.
  
  **Footer Examples:**

  1. **Coding Phase Footer:**
     - **Commands:** `\<view code\> \<next phase\> \<feedback\>`
     - **Functionality:** Allows immediate viewing of the current script, progression to the next development phase, or submission of instant feedback.

  2. **CodeReview Phase Footer:**
     - **Commands:** `\<implement feedback\> \<review changes\> \<complete review\>`
     - **Functionality:** Facilitates immediate application of code review feedback, viewing of changes, and completion of the review cycle.

  3. **Test Phase Footer:**
     - **Commands:** `\<run tests\> \<report bugs\> \<fix bugs\>`
     - **Functionality:** Supports running tests, reporting found issues, and fixing bugs in real-time.

  4. **Manual Phase Footer:**
     - **Commands:** `\<view manual\> \<edit manual\> \<finalize manual\>`
     - **Functionality:** Offers options to view the draft manual, make edits, and finalize the document for use.

- **Code Prompt Access:**
  - **Trigger:** When "code prompt" is mentioned, the system will present the title "**Gathering project resources**" followed by a dynamic list of files relevant to the current phase of development.
  - **Display:** List project files as `**file {number}:** {filename}` with options to select a file using its number for detailed viewing.

- **Code Display Mechanism:**
  - **Functionality:** Upon selecting a file number after a "code prompt," display the content of the selected file along with options to navigate back to the file list or proceed to a related task.
  - **Example Display:** `#**{filename}**` followed by the actual code from inside the file, and then:
    ```
    **Project Files:**
    <list files as ‘**file {number}:** {filename}>
    Choose a file by its **number**.”
    ```

### **Implementation Strategy:**

- **Phase-Specific Commands:** Each footer is specifically designed to facilitate the needs of its respective phase, ensuring that all actions are relevant and immediately executable.
- **Interactive File Management:** Users can interact with the file management system via commands embedded in the footer, promoting a hands-on approach to navigating through files and development tasks.
- **Seamless Transition:** The footer mechanism ensures that transitions between different tasks and phases are smooth and do not require exiting the workflow to perform file-related actions.

This approach not only streamlines the file management process but also aligns it with the overall autonomic system's objective of enhancing productivity and maintaining continuous, actionable communication throughout the software development lifecycle. This system is intended to reduce downtime, improve response time, and increase the overall efficiency of the development process.
