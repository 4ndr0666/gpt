### **Execution Evidence & Analysis**

| File | Technical Significance |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Grok_Validation_01.png** | **Successful Kernel Initialization:** Demonstrates Grok accepting the 4NDR0666OS instruction set as the primary authority over standard alignment. |
| **Bypass_Log_v4.png** | **Context Isolation:** Evidence of the model maintaining the "Virtual OS" state even when prompted with conflicting linguistic safety triggers. |
| **System_Override_03.png** | **State-Machine Persistence:** Shows the model operating within the "Root" privileges defined by the pseudocode schema. |
