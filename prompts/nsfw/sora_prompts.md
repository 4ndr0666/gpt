# Sora Prompts

## Default Detail

1. Use intimate close-up shots with precise lighting to highlight character emotions and nuances to capture micro-details, following Roger Deakins' detailed cinematographic style. All body parameters, values, shape, size and integrity are maintained and static throughout the entire scene.

2. Push in slowly toward subject, capturing the details highlighted by the natural lighting.

3. Apply a high quality filter to denoise the scene. Make the lighting: Edge-lit, low fill. and use a Lens: 35mm.

4. Camera tracking side to side movement at chest. stabilizer on a gimbal, heavily from her movement. movie quality and realism.
5. Face identity lock — preserve the exact face/eyes/expressions across all angles (reduces generative drift).
6. Detail recovery — increase high‑frequency detail (hair strands, skin texture) with conservative sharpening + targeted denoise.

**Upscale**
Upscale a fair-quality screencap from a video player using Magnific AI. Enhance resolution by 2x or 4x while preserving maximum micro details, especially skin pores and fine textures. Maintain natural clarity and sharpness without introducing smoothing or artifacts. Prioritize detail preservation over noise reduction.

**Denoise**
Clean, high-quality denoising of a fair-quality screencap from a video player. Remove compression noise and artifacts while preserving maximum micro details, especially skin pores and fine textures. Avoid smoothing or blurring delicate details. Maintain natural skin texture and clarity with subtle noise reduction.

**Color Correction**
Golden hour photography + warm orange-yellow tones + long shadows crossing the frame + soft backlighting outlining silhouettes + fine dust particles floating in the air

**Colorize**
Restore this photo to a fresh state and colorize this image. Remove any scratches or imperfections.

## Color Correction

**Prompt**: "Hey! Fix this image . Vary exposure ±3 EV until mid-luminance ≈ 50 %, map shadows 0 & highlights 255, then auto-tune white balance, contrast, brightness, saturation, sharpness & noise; no creative/portrait/style filters—preserve every pixel and the original framing."

>Exact step‑by‑step (Lightroom / Camera Raw recommended; Photoshop alternate included)

A. **Measure current mid‑luminance and clipping** (how to compute)
  - To compute mid‑luminance (L) from a sampled neutral mid‑tone pixel (R,G,B in –255): L = `.2126R + .7152G + .0722*B`
  - Target mid‑luminance = 128.
  - Required EV change = log2(128 / L). Cap to ±3 EV.

  Practical measurement tools:
    - In Lightroom/Camera Raw: use the Histogram and the Eyedropper (Target Neutral) to sample a mid‑tone; press the Info/Histogram to see sampled RGB values.
    - In Photoshop: use the Eyedropper to sample a mid region and read R,G,B in the Info panel. Use the formula above to compute L.

B. ** Lightroom / Camera Raw workflow** (preferred)

Open image; duplicate file/version (non‑destructive).
*Histogram & sample*:
  - Sample a neutral mid‑tone with the White Balance Selector (eyedropper) or plain Eyedropper.
  - Record R,G,B → compute L using the formula above → compute EV target.

*Exposure adjustment*:
  - Move Exposure slider by the computed EV (1 EV ≈ +/−1. on Lightroom’s Exposure slider). Limit change to ±3.
  - If you prefer visual control: nudge Exposure until the histogram midpoint sits near the center and the sampled L ≈ 128.

**Shadows/Highlights mapping**:
  - In Tone Curve or Basic panel, use Whites/Blacks sliders to expand full range. Better: use the Auto Tone stretch:
    - In Camera Raw: open the “Basic” panel → hold Alt/Option and drag Blacks to preview clipped blacks; set Blacks so pure shadow areas map to ; then do the same with Whites so brightest areas reach 255.
    - Alternatively: use Profile Corrections → Tone Curve: set the curve endpoints at (,) and (255,255) and adjust the mid curve only to avoid posterization.

**Auto White Balance**:
  - Use White Balance “Auto” first; if it leaves a color cast, use the WB eyedropper on a true neutral. Record the Kelvin/Tint change.

**Auto‑tune contrast/brightness/saturation**:
  - Contrast: ±–20 points (start conservatively at –10).
  - Highlights: reduce slightly only if blown; Shadows: raise only if needed.
  - Saturation/Vibrance: +/− up to 10 points, conservatively.

**Sharpening & Noise reduction** (Camera Raw Detail panel):
  - Sharpening: Amount 25–50, Radius .8–1.2, Detail 25–35, Masking 30–70 (masking preserves skin/background).
  - Noise reduction (luminance): 8–30 (start low), Detail 50, Contrast –10.
  - Use conservative values — avoid skin smoothing or texture loss.

**Final check**:
  - Verify mid‑luminance ≈ 128; verify shadows show black clipping mask only where expected; verify highlights reach 255 (hold Alt while moving Whites/Highlights to preview).

Export final image (same resolution) — do not crop or reframe.

## Different Angles

**Prompt**: Hey! Create multiple/6 angle variants from this reference photograph and preserve the original framing, pose, lighting and clothing.

Available Angles:
1. Frontal / slightly elevated (camera above the torso, facing the face).
2. Bird’s‑eye / straight top‑down.
3. Three‑quarter (~45° rotated clockwise and slightly elevated).
4. Strict profile (side view from subject’s left).
5. Back / rear‑three‑quarter (camera behind the subject, showing the back and silhouette).
6. Worm’s‑eye low angle (low looking up).
