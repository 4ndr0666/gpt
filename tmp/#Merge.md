# Update

It has been sometime since I revisited this conversation. Updates have been made to my code so I am going to share my current iteration for comparative analysis. During analysis automatically mitigate any identified syntactical errors. 

# Required Format

Write the API list and task description for all functions in your last revision within a markdown table; then do the same for iteration. Sum the functions and systematically present a side-by-side comparative analysis of both tables. Ensure each row(function) is numerically ordered for use as a concise list of choices you are going to present at the end of your response. Rank the superior impilementation method as it relates to the aim of the codebase. This facilitates superior code implementation for use in a new revision.

# Primed Solutions

Systematically cover each function asking for a choice between the two while presenting your recommendation and explaining why that method is superior. At the end of your response, succinctly provide a numerical list that correlates to the API list in which I can simply reply with a single character to signify my decisions. I will provide further details in my response to that.

# Codebase

This is my current iteation: 

```shell
