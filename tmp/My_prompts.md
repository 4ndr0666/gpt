It details the process of using planes, lines, projection paths, and vanishing points to reconstruct the position and orientation of a 3D object.

---

#### **Key Terminology**

1. **Projection Plane (P.P.)**:
   - The 2D surface where the 3D object is projected.
   - In drawings, it’s typically the plane ( pi ) or ( alpha ), representing the view from the front, side, or top.

2. **Vanishing Point (P.V.)**:
   - The point where parallel lines in 3D appear to converge when projected in 2D.
   - Axonometric projections use one or more vanishing points based on the view angle.

3. **Principal Vanishing Point (P.V.P.)**:
   - The main vanishing point where most critical projection lines converge.
   - Acts as the reference for perspective alignment.

4. **Line of Sight (L.O.S.)**:
   - The direction from which the observer views the 3D object, determining projection angles.

5. **Projection Lines (P.L.)**:
   - Lines extending from the 3D object to the projection plane, essential for scale and location in 2D.

6. **Intersection Points**:
   - Points where projection lines and planes meet, determining object placement in 2D.

7. **Horizontal Projection (H.P.)**:
   - 2D projection of horizontal dimensions of the object onto the projection plane.

8. **Vertical Projection (V.P.)**:
   - 2D projection of vertical dimensions like height.

9. **Plane of Reference (R.P.)**:
   - The base plane for measurements and projections, such as ( pi ).

10. **Inclination Angles**:
   - Angles between object axes (X, Y, Z) and projection planes, such as 30°/60° in isometric views.

---

#### **Universal Labeling System**

- **Planes**: ( pi ) (horizontal), ( alpha ) (vertical/inclined), ( beta ), ( gamma ) for additional planes.
- **Lines**: ( L_O ) (origin), ( L_T ) (termination) for defining dimensions.
- **Vanishing Points**: ( P.V. ), ( P.V._x ), ( P.V._y ), ( P.V._z ) for axis-specific points.
- **Projection Lines**: ( P.L._x ), ( P.L._y ), ( P.L._z ), marked by ( I_{x,y,z} ) for intersections.

---

#### **Step-by-Step Instructions for Drawing a 3D Structure**

1. **Set Up Planes**:
   - Define planes ( pi ) (horizontal) and ( alpha ) (vertical/inclined).
   - Mark intersections at origin ( O ).

2. **Determine Vanishing Point**:
   - Select **Principal Vanishing Point (P.V.)** for alignment.
   - Draw projection lines ( P.L. ) to this point.

3. **Trace Projection Lines**:
   - Project 3D points to the 2D plane using ( P.L._x ), ( P.L._y ), ( P.L._z ).
   - Label intersection points ( I_{x,y,z} ).

# === // ROLLBACK DEBUGGING // =================================
# Methodical Rollback and Debugging

## **Prompt Objective**
1. **Diagnose a codebase** that has become unstable or introduced new errors after recent changes.
2. **Roll back modifications** systematically, one at a time, to **identify and isolate** the breaking change(s) or synergy errors.
3. **Document** all functionalities in an **API/feature list** (or “task list”), so we can revert changes individually or in small groups, then retest.
4. **Iterate** through each identified feature or function to confirm its stability or revert if it breaks the code.
5. **Reintroduce** each previously reverted change only after the script or application is stable, verifying the fix or logic correction.

---

## **Step 1: Generate the Feature/Function API List**

1. **Action**: Create an **API list** (or function/feature list) from the existing code:
   - Present each function or significant feature in a **markdown table**.
   - Columns might include: **Task ID**, **Function/Feature**, **Methodology** (implementation approach), and **Status**.
   - **Status** can be: _Pending_, _In Progress_, or _Completed_.

2. **Purpose**: This list forms the blueprint for every introduced feature or modification, making it easy to roll back or fix them individually.

### **Example Table**:
| **Task ID** | **Feature/Function**       | **Methodology**                              | **Status**   |
|-------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------|
| T1          | `auto_merge_mode()`        | Auto merges multiple videos sequentially     | Pending      |
| T2          | `motion_interpolation` param | Uses SVPflow or VapourSynth for HFR        | Pending      |
| T3          | Extended user prompts      | Additional user options: container, codec   | Completed    |

---

## **Step 2: Establish a Known Good Baseline**

1. **Action**: Identify the *last stable version* (known good) of the code before the new changes were introduced.
2. **Purpose**: This version is your **baseline** or “safe point.” The new code’s changes are layered on top of this.

---

## **Step 3: Systematic Rollback of Changes**

1. **Action**: For each identified feature/function (or group of features) from the **API list**:
   - Locate the code modifications related to that feature.
   - **Comment out** or **remove** those changes.
   - **Test** the application after removing that single feature.

2. **Purpose**: By systematically reverting one feature (or small group) at a time, pinpoint exactly which modification triggers the error or synergy conflict.

### **Detailed Steps**:
1. **Pick a single TID** from the markdown table.
2. **Revert** (remove or comment out) the associated code.
3. **Rebuild/Test** the application or script.
4. If the code works again, the reverted change likely contained or triggered the breakage. If it remains broken, proceed to the next TID.

---

## **Step 4: Review and Reintroduction**

1. **Action**: Once the code is stable again after removing a feature, investigate that feature’s logic.
2. **Purpose**: Fix or refine the logic, then **reintroduce** it carefully, testing again to ensure stability.

### **Implementation**:
1. Identify the root cause or synergy error (e.g., array indexing, parameter mismatches).
2. Correct the logic or synergy conflicts.
3. Re-implement the feature with incremental testing.

---

## **Step 5: Real-Time Updates in the API Table**

1. **Action**: **Update the status** of each TID (Task ID) in your table as you revert or fix it.
2. **Purpose**: Maintain clarity on what has been reverted, what remains pending, and what is successfully integrated.

### **Example Updated Table**:
| **Task ID** | **Feature**               | **Methodology**                              | **Status**     |
|-------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------|
| T1          | `auto_merge_mode()`       | Auto merges multiple videos sequentially     | **Reverted**   |
| T2          | `motion_interpolation` param | Uses SVPflow or VapourSynth for HFR        | **Completed**  |
| T3          | Extended user prompts     | Container, codec, CRF/Bitrate, fps prompts  | **Kept**       |

---

## **Step 6: Final Verification**

1. **Action**: After all changes have been individually tested (reverted, then carefully reintroduced), confirm that the code is fully functional:
   - **No placeholders** or incomplete logic remain.
   - No synergy errors exist between newly reintroduced features.
   - The final code is stable and production-ready.
