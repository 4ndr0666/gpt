# Basic Observational Protocol

## Objective

To collect qualitative and basic quantitative data on interpersonal interactions in everyday settings with the inclusion of a monozygotic twin.

## Setup

- **Participants:**
  - Primary participant (study conductor).
  - Monozygotic twin.
  - Regular social contacts (friends, family, colleagues).

- **Environment:**
  - Select 2–3 natural locations (e.g., home, workplace, café).
  - Maintain consistent settings across both phases.

## Phases

1. **Baseline Phase (No Twin):**
   - Duration: 1–2 weeks.
   - Collect data on regular interactions without the twin present.

2. **Intervention Phase (With Twin):**
   - Duration: 1–2 weeks.
   - Repeat interactions with the twin included.

## Data Collection

- **Observation Diary:**
  - Log details of each interaction (date, time, location, participants, and observations).
- **Post-Interaction Surveys:**
  - Short questionnaires to capture immediate reactions and group dynamics.
- **Optional Recordings:**
  - Audio/video recordings (with consent) for detailed behavior analysis.

## Analysis

- **Qualitative Analysis:**
  - Identify and compare recurring patterns in behavior and communication.
- **Quantitative Analysis:**
  - Count frequencies (e.g., speaking time, number of interaction initiations).
- **Reporting:**
  - Summarize differences in “Before Twin” versus “With Twin” conditions.

*This basic protocol serves as an initial framework to gauge the influence of a monozygotic twin on natural human interactions.*
