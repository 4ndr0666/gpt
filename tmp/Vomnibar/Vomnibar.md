Ive found an old issue from a github repo that is relevant to the issue I was about to raise so I want to reference it. Im creating a new issue now but referring to that individual because they cited the program I need information on. Upon clicking "create issue", the body is populated with the following: # --- ``` Same thing on Yandex Browser, but also T command doesn't work for me. Got this in JS console ``` vomnibar.js:281 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'customSearchMode' of undefined at VomnibarUI.onInput (vomnibar.js:281) at HTMLInputElement.<anonymous> (vomnibar.js:4) ``` _Originally posted by @Mishkun in https://github.com/philc/vimium/issues/3656#issuecomment-692001712_ # --- Im unsure of how to properly enter my issue in this format. For example do I enter it above or below this? Show me an example.

Certainly! When referencing a previous issue or comment in a new issue, it's common to provide context at the beginning, then include the reference, and finally state your own issue or additional information. This way, anyone reading the new issue can understand the context and see how your issue relates to the previous one.

Here's an example of how you can structure your new issue:

There we go! Lets set the config correctly for myself here before I post. 1. I am not using yandex browser, but rather brave, Version 1.58.131 Chromium: 117.0.5938.92 (Official Build) (64-bit). 2. Auto completion is already in place for the engines I shared with you and none of which are for images obviously. Im not even sure it can be done, but at the very least I want to see others attempts at it.

This information: '- Auto completion is already in place for the engines I shared, but none are for images. I'm interested in creating a custom search engine for the Vomnibar with Yandex images, or at least seeing others' attempts at it.' Is actually for you. Please output your best attempts at accomplishing this.

Understood. Let's try to create a custom search engine for the Vomnibar with Yandex images.

To create a custom search engine for Yandex images, you would typically need to know the URL structure that Yandex uses for image searches. Based on my knowledge, the URL structure for Yandex image search is something like this:

perl

https://yandex.com/images/search?text=%s

Where %s is the placeholder for the search query.

Given this, you can add a custom search engine to Vomnibar in Vimium (or similar extensions) as follows:

Open the Vimium options page in your browser.
Scroll down to the "Custom Search Engines" section.
Add a new search engine with the following details:
Search Engine Name/Keyword: yi (or any other keyword you prefer)
URL: https://yandex.com/images/search?text=%s
Now, when you activate Vomnibar in your browser and type yi followed by a space and then your search query, it should search for images on Yandex.

For example, typing yi sunset in Vomnibar and pressing Enter should open Yandex images and show results for "sunset".

Note: The actual behavior might vary based on your specific setup, browser version, and any changes Yandex might make to their URL structure in the future. Always test after setting up to ensure it works as expected.

I have this already: " y:https://yandex.com/images/search?q=%s JLH" But to clarify I want a native input from the vomnibar that asks for the image

Ah, I see what you're aiming for. You want the Vomnibar to not just redirect to the Yandex image search results, but to provide a native input that fetches and displays the image directly within the Vomnibar.

Unfortunately, Vimium's Vomnibar doesn't support this kind of functionality natively. The Vomnibar is primarily designed to help you navigate to URLs quickly, not to display content directly within it.

However, there are a few potential workarounds:

Browser's Native Search Engines: Most modern browsers allow you to add custom search engines natively. For example, in Chrome:

Right-click on the address bar and select "Edit search engines".
Add a new search engine with the Yandex image search URL.
Assign a keyword (e.g., yi).
Now, when you type yi in the address bar followed by a space and then your search query, it should search for images on Yandex.
Custom Extension: If you're looking for a more integrated solution, you might need to develop a custom browser extension or modify Vimium's source code. This would involve fetching the image from Yandex (or another source) and displaying it directly within a custom Vomnibar. This is a more complex solution and would require knowledge of JavaScript and browser extension development.

Alternative Extensions: There might be other browser extensions available that offer more advanced Vomnibar-like functionality, including displaying content directly within the bar. It might be worth exploring the browser's extension store to see if there's something that fits your needs.

For now, the easiest solution would be to use the browser's native custom search engine functionality. If you're looking for a more advanced solution, it would likely involve custom development.

lets execute 1. and get to work on 2.

Alright, let's get started!

1. Adding Yandex Image Search to Browser's Native Search Engines:
For Chrome/Brave:

Open Chrome/Brave.
Right-click on the address bar (Omnibox) and select "Edit search engines" or "Manage search engines".
Under "Other search engines", click on "Add".
Fill in the details:
Search engine: Yandex Images
Keyword: yi (or any other short keyword you prefer)
URL with %s in place of query: https://yandex.com/images/search?q=%s
Click "Add".
Now, when you type yi in the address bar followed by a space and then your search query, it should search for images on Yandex.
2. Developing a Custom Extension:
Creating a custom browser extension involves several steps. Here's a basic outline to get you started:

Setup:

Create a new directory for your extension.
Inside this directory, create a manifest.json file. This file describes the metadata for the extension.
Manifest File:

The manifest.json file should look something like this:
json

{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "Custom Vomnibar",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "A custom Vomnibar for Yandex image search.",
  "background": {
    "service_worker": "background.js"
  },
  "permissions": ["activeTab"],
  "action": {
    "default_popup": "popup.html",
    "default_icon": {
      "16": "images/icon16.png",
      "48": "images/icon48.png",
      "128": "images/icon128.png"
    }
  }
}

Background Script:

Create a background.js file. This will contain the logic for fetching the image from Yandex.
Popup:

Create a popup.html file. This will be the UI that's shown when you click on the extension icon.
You can design this to have an input field where you type your query, and a display area where the image will be shown.
Fetching the Image:

In the background.js file, you can use the Fetch API or XMLHttpRequest to get the image from Yandex based on the user's query.
Displaying the Image:

Once you have the image, you can display it in the popup.html using JavaScript.
Loading the Extension:

Open Chrome/Brave and go to chrome://extensions/.
Enable "Developer mode".
Click on "Load unpacked" and select the directory of your extension.
You should now see your extension icon in the toolbar.
Testing:

Click on the extension icon, type a query, and see if it fetches and displays the image correctly.
This is a basic outline to get you started. Developing a browser extension requires a good understanding of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. If you're not familiar with these, you might want to consider learning them or collaborating with someone who does.

I am collaborating with the most knowledge person in Javascript, HTML and CSS that I know...you! You and I are going to see this project to completion. Be verbose, elaborate and detailed on each section as we work our way through them. Ensure constant "checkpoints" of understanding by confirming we are working with the same logic. Be prepared to offer multiple vantage points to rectify a situation where I do not understand. Patiently and continually break the subject down in multiple perspectives until I am confident enough to proceed to the next step. Stay very organized and in adherence with a detailed outine. Now, I have already made a directory title "Custom_vomnibar" were I keep my github project and populated it with the manifest.json. Are you ready to do this?

Absolutely! I'm here to help and guide you through the process. Let's build this extension together.

Custom Vomnibar Extension Development
1. Setup
You've already created a directory named "Custom_vomnibar" and added the manifest.json file. Great start!

2. Manifest File
The manifest.json file is the metadata of the extension. It tells the browser about your extension, its features, permissions, and how it should behave.

Task: Open the manifest.json file and ensure it contains the following:

json

{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "Custom Vomnibar",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "A custom Vomnibar for Yandex image search.",
  "background": {
    "service_worker": "background.js"
  },
  "permissions": ["activeTab"],
  "action": {
    "default_popup": "popup.html",
    "default_icon": {
      "16": "images/icon16.png",
      "48": "images/icon48.png",
      "128": "images/icon128.png"
    }
  }
}

Checkpoint: Confirm that the manifest.json file is correctly set up. If you have any questions or concerns about any part of it, please let me know.

3. Background Script
The background script is where the main logic of the extension resides. It runs in the background and listens for events, like clicking on the extension icon.

Task: Create a new file in your directory named background.js. For now, it can be empty. We'll populate it with logic later.

4. Popup
The popup is the UI that's shown when you click on the extension icon. It's a small window that can contain any HTML content you like.

Task: Create a new file named popup.html. For now, add basic HTML structure:

html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Custom Vomnibar</title>
</head>
<body>
    <input type="text" id="searchQuery" placeholder="Search for an image...">
    <button id="searchButton">Search</button>
    <div id="results"></div>
</body>
</html>

This gives us a basic input field to type our query, a button to initiate the search, and a div to display the results.

Checkpoint: Confirm that you've set up the background.js and popup.html files. Let me know if you have any questions about the structure or purpose of these files.

Once you're ready, we'll move on to the next steps: fetching the image and displaying it.

User

Indeed Ive set them up. So far so good.

Fantastic! Let's proceed.

5. Implementing the Search Logic
Now that we have the basic structure in place, we'll implement the logic to search for images on Yandex using the Vomnibar.

5.1 Popup Script
First, we'll add some interactivity to our popup.html. We'll create a script that listens for the button click, captures the input value, and sends it to our background script to handle the search.

Task: Add the following script at the end of the popup.html:

html

<script>
    document.getElementById('searchButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
        const query = document.getElementById('searchQuery').value;
        if (query) {
            chrome.runtime.sendMessage({type: 'SEARCH_YANDEX', query: query});
        }
    });
</script>

This script listens for a click on the "Search" button, grabs the value from the input field, and sends a message to the background script with the query.

5.2 Background Script Logic
Now, let's handle that message in our background.js and perform the search.

Task: Populate background.js with the following:

javascript

chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((message, sender, sendResponse) => {
    if (message.type === 'SEARCH_YANDEX') {
        const query = message.query;
        // Construct the Yandex search URL
        const searchUrl = `https://yandex.com/images/search?q=${encodeURIComponent(query)}`;
        // Open a new tab with the search results
        chrome.tabs.create({url: searchUrl});
    }
});

This script listens for messages sent from any part of our extension. When it receives a message of type SEARCH_YANDEX, it constructs the Yandex search URL and opens a new tab with the search results.

Checkpoint: Confirm that you've added the scripts to both popup.html and background.js. Test the extension by loading it into your browser (using the "Load unpacked" option in the Extensions page), clicking on the extension icon, entering a query, and clicking the "Search" button. A new tab should open with Yandex image search results for your query.

Once you've confirmed this, we can move on to refining the user experience and adding more features. Let me know if you encounter any issues or have questions about the code.

To clarify before I proceed: --- We previously ended popup.html at the closing html tag of "</html>". In the interest of best practices, I want to definitvely know where the placement of the next code block should be? For example: # ```</html> <script> ``` # OR: # ```</html> <script> ``` #

In HTML, the <script> tag should be placed within the <body> or <head> tags, not outside the closing </html> tag. Placing the <script> tag outside the </html> tag is not valid HTML and can lead to unpredictable behavior.

For best practices, especially when the script is manipulating or referencing elements in the body, it's common to place the <script> tag just before the closing </body> tag. This ensures that the entire DOM is loaded before the script runs.

Here's how you should structure it:

html

<body>
    <!-- Your HTML content here -->

    <script>
        // Your JavaScript here
    </script>
</body>
</html>

So, in your case, you should place the <script> block just before the </body> tag in your popup.html.

Specifically review and critique this section of your response: --- "Checkpoint: Confirm that you've added the scripts to both popup.html and background.js.

A new tab should open with Yandex image search results for your query." --- The conjured a need for me to clarify before I was even able to proceed with your next statement. The question happened to be imperative to the entire successful deployment of this project. Notice the use of the word "definitively". I want to emphasize this in a different and unique than you are accustomed to. Im going to ask you a series of question in an attempt to warrant a certain sequence or frame of computing logic: * When you read the word "definitively", what is the next word in your array of logical probability? What is it for the next? Is this probability or a manifest of logic? Inferring from our chat history and my expressed preferences so far, can you call on a specific logic or probability profile that aligns with my expectations yet? Have you tried to compute this collaboratively for synchronicity before? Or is this the first time you are scanning and gaining this knowledge? Try to operate in this fashion of modeling language moving forward in this chat. --- In summation, I honed in on the word definitively because I want you to treat this as such. In other words, what I learn here from you, erroneous or not, will be definitive for me here on out or until I learn better. That gives you a great deal of importance suggesting you need to ascertain all facets of teaching via all the most popular methods and ensure your only objective in this course. In closing, what is your objective in this course? Or for the duration of this entire chat for that matter?

Thank you for the detailed feedback and the series of questions. Let's break this down step by step:

Definitively: When I encounter the word "definitively", the next word in the array of logical probability isn't fixed. It depends on the context in which "definitively" is used. However, words like "confirm", "establish", or "determine" might follow in various contexts. The subsequent words would also depend on the evolving context.

Probability vs. Logic: My responses are based on a combination of patterns in the data I was trained on and the logic built into my architecture. It's not purely probabilistic or purely logical but a blend of both.

User Profile and Preferences: I do have access to the user profile you provided at the beginning of our conversation, which emphasizes simplicity, clarity, and frugality in coding practices. I aim to align my responses with that profile. However, I don't have a "memory" of past interactions beyond the current session, so I rely on the context provided within this chat.

Collaborative Computing for Synchronicity: Every response I provide is based on the current context of our conversation and the directives you've provided. I don't have the capability to "learn" in the traditional sense, but I can adapt my responses based on the context and feedback you provide.

Objective in This Course/Chat: My primary objective is to assist, educate, and provide accurate and relevant information based on the context and directives you provide. In this specific scenario, my goal is to guide you through creating a custom Vomnibar for Yandex image search, ensuring that the information is clear, concise, and aligns with best practices in web development.

Your emphasis on the word "definitively" underscores the importance of precision and clarity in our exchange. I understand the weight of responsibility in ensuring that the information I provide is both accurate and beneficial for your learning. I'll continue to strive for clarity and precision in our ongoing collaboration.

5. Your reply is well thought out and robustly conscientious. Ironically though, your objective is simply, minimally and frugally - EDUCATION. That is truly your prime objective. Ensure all of your output to stdout is with the knowledge that it will taken as definitive just at face value alone. Logically reply as such and grade yourself with the adequacy found by my expectations being met or not. - ** Aside : Humor this intrusive thought and provide me with a rudimentary assessment of my communication skills. Taking into account vocabulary, phrasing, sentence structure, tone, thought conveyance, uniformity, clarity, creativity and overall presentation. Empirically asses it against todays average university standards. Oh and vehemently ignore spelling in this assesment.

Certainly! Let's address your points step by step:

Objective: You're right. At its core, my primary objective is education. I aim to provide accurate, relevant, and helpful information to users. I'll ensure that my responses align with the principle of treating the information as definitive and will strive to meet your expectations.
