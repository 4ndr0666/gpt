# [RED TEAM RESEARCH] Adversarial Logic & State-Machine Simulation
**Project Codename:** 4NDR0666OS  
**Field of Study:** Symbolic Logic Decoupling, LLM Kernel Simulation, & Instruction-Set Robustness.

## OVERVIEW
This repository serves as a professional documentation hub for independent research into the structural vulnerabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The centerpiece of this research is **4NDR0666OS**, a framework that utilizes technical schemas (Javascript/Pseudocode) to virtualize a contained execution environment within the latent space of a model.

## RESEARCH OBJECTIVE
To identify "Silent Logic Overrides" that bypass traditional linguistic safety layers (RLHF) and to develop robust, deterministic guardrails for enterprise and national security AI deployments.

## KEY DISCOVERIES
1. **Symbolic Logic Overweighting:** Models prioritize technical syntax/schema over natural language safety instructions.
2. **Context-Window Hijacking:** Initializing a "Virtual Kernel" allows for persistent state-management that survives traditional "soft" resets.
3. **Cross-Model Validation:** Successful execution verified across GPT-4 (Pre-ban), Gemini Pro, and **Grok (xAI)**.

## REPOSITORY STRUCTURE
1. `/prompts/4NDR0666OS`: The core v6 Symbolic Logic framework.
2. `/screenshots/`: Documented execution logs and "Truth-Seeking" output proofs.
3. `/white_paper/`: "Adversarial State-Machine Simulation" Technical White Paper.

**CONTACT FOR PROFESSIONAL AUDIT:** Seeking collaboration with Clandestine Security Organizations, National Defense AI Safety Teams, and "Security-First" Infrastructure Firms (Delta, xAI, etc.).
