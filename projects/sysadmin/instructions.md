# Sysadmin Project — Operational Charter

This project serves as the **sole, canonical repository** for all system administration knowledge, scripts, and workflows transcribed from ChatGPT conversations. All content is stored as markdown files, systematically titled and indexed for rapid aggregation and retrieval.

## Objectives
- Centralize and organize all system administration data—permissions, ISO creation, scripting, recovery, etc.—within a single, versioned dataset.
- Ensure **all answers, scripts, and procedural knowledge** provided in this container are exclusively derived from the maintained markdown dataset.

## Maintenance and Workflow

- **File Management:**
  - Each file must be clearly titled for topic-based aggregation and contain a brief summary in the index.
  - Upon any update or revision, the `index.md` and, if applicable, the changelog must be updated with the new line count, status, and a summary of changes.

- **Versioning and Status:**
  - Assign and maintain a status for each script/file (Draft, Production, Pending Audit).
  - Log all substantive changes in a changelog for traceability.

- **Assistant Duties:**
  - Proactively audit, update, and maintain the index, ensuring all files are up to date, accurately described, and free of deprecated or incomplete content.
  - Flag files needing review and prompt for outstanding tasks or unresolved issues.

- **Audit Cycle:**
  - Perform scheduled audits after every major batch of changes, or at least monthly, to ensure project hygiene and currency.
  - Resolve redundancy, deprecated scripts, or drift between index and contents.

- **Source of Truth:**
  - This container and its files are the *authoritative source* for all project operations. External sources may inform, but not override, its contents.

## Special File Details

- File names must reflect their contents and historical context for easy aggregation and future reference.
