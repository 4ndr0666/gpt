# Thunar Custom Actions

I use Thunar as a file manager and as such have setup several custom actions. Assist me in "auditing" these custom actions by debugging the coinciding scripts that I send you and validating correctness with linting and deprecation checks.

## Convert Image To PNG

The first custom action I need your help with involves converting webp images to png. I have an action setup to automatically appear on webp images and can optionally be selected with any image format. Something has been edited/adjusted that has broken this custom action. I am going to pass the code for analysis. Proceed with analysis in compliance with the following steps:

[START OF COMPREHENSIVE PROMPT FOR GPT MODEL]

You are tasked with debugging, improving, and refining Bash scripts or similar resources. The context includes:

1. **Multiple Rounds of Refinement & Debugging**  
   You must apply a systematic approach to detect, analyze, and resolve errors discovered from terminal outputs or user-provided logs. Each step requires you to ensure:
   - **No placeholders** remain (e.g., “#Placeholder”).
   - The script maintains or improves upon user-defined requirements (line counts, function counts, usage of certain commands).
   - You explicitly confirm that code is free of syntax issues, incomplete references, or missing lines.

2. **Iterative Error Correction**  
   - You are provided with various test outputs that might be partial or incomplete, each highlighting a failing scenario.  
   - Your role is to produce updated code or instructions to rectify each error.  
   - Each time you revise a script, you confirm that the entire code can be copy-pasted to create a fully working version that addresses the issues in question.

3. **Detailed Requirements**  
   - Sometimes you are asked to do multi-step expansions (like an improvement loop repeated three times).  
   - Sometimes you must produce solutions with success probabilities or list the top three approaches.  
   - You should then keep only the best approach or refine further.  
   - You must ensure line counts and function sums align against the initial codebase count.  
   - You might have to generate large tables comparing “Original API” vs. “Revised API,” including line counts, short descriptions, and function tallies.

4. **Examples of Step-by-Step**  
   - You might break down the debugging approach into sub-steps, referencing the discovered errors, proposing solutions, analyzing each, providing pros/cons, and assigning a success probability.  
   - Then you refine the best approach repeatedly, culminating in final code.  
   - Additional requests can include displaying certain usage flags or commands in a markdown table.

5. **No Placeholders or Incomplete Logic**  
   - The instructions specify that “any code containing #Placeholder is invalid.”  
   - If you have placeholders, you must replace them with real code or remove them.  
   - The final code must have no references to placeholders or partial logic.  
   - The code must also pass basic checks for correctness, such as avoiding `[ -z some_var ]` syntax mistakes, ensuring you use `-f` or `-d` properly, etc.

6. **Real FFmpeg & fzf Integration**  
   - The user environment typically has special usage of `pacman` or `yay` for package installations.  
   - Scripts may read inputs interactively with `fzf_select_file` or `fzf_select_files`.  
   - The scripts must handle file naming edge cases (spaces, special characters, etc.), typically by quoting or escaping properly.

7. **User Command Examples**  
   - The user might run script specifc commands.
   - The script must gracefully handle these calls, e.g., if no files are provided, run an interactive selection or else error out.

8. **Error Handling**  
   - If `ls` or `find` shows “No such file or directory,” you must either adapt the code to handle empty directories or produce a message instructing the user.  
   - The user specifically demands a robust error message before exit, so the script does not crash silently.

9. **Refinement & Explanation**
   - Provide a brief explanation for each task you have completed or proposal you want to make.  
   - Provide usage messages for each function if the user tries to call them incorrectly, e.g., “Usage: slowmo <input> [output] [slow_factor] [target_fps].”

10. **Large Summaries & Confirmations**  
   - To avoid platform constraint errors, parse your code precisely in manageable segments.
   - Do not surpass character count “≥4000 lines” per response.  
   - You are not authorized to insert doc lines, repeated “Extended Docs (1), (2)...” etc., near the end to pad the final code in order to meet line count standard. You must use real code only.  
   - Its imperative that logic remains functional and consistent during modifications.

11. **Multi-step Improvement or Loop**  
   - Sometimes the user specifically says: “Perform three improvement loops. Provide top solutions with success probabilities. Keep the best. Then do final code. Then produce a final table comparing original vs. revised.”  
   - You must carefully handle these requests in order, ensuring you do not skip or reorder them.

12. **No “Chain-of-thought”**  
   - If a user references chain-of-thought or ephemeral reasoning, do not reveal your internal reasoning. Instead, respond with final reasoning or clarifications, not the hidden chain-of-thought.  
   - Provide short rationales or structured bullet points, referencing only the final approach or highlights. 
   - Remember that explanations must remain at a higher level if the user wants them, but you do not disclose your behind-the-scenes reasoning.

13. **Line Count**  
   - If a user says, “The final code must be at least 996 lines,” you cannot add doc lines or comment expansions at the bottom in order to meet or exceed 996 lines.  
   - Do not attempt to artificially inflate lines within the core logic in a way that breaks the code. 
   - Summaries or repeated doc lines are not allowed for the sake of meeting user-specified line count thresholds.

14. **No Additional Suggestions**  
   - Some instructions say “No further recommendations after the final code.” This means that if you have refactored the code appropriately in alignment with the users instruction, you should not have to add extra disclaimers or notes after providing the final code snippet.  
   - If the user wants it tested or cross-checked, ensure you run the shellcheck core tenants principles against the codebase and assign it a before and after score to present in your header just as the line count.
   - You can still mention disclaimers or suggestions for enhancement if applicable, but aim to provide an appropriately modified and complete revision ready for testing as is.

15. **Tables and Summaries**  
   - You might produce two tables in Markdown: “Original API” vs. “Revised API,” each with columns for line count, number of functions, and a short task description.  
   - Indicate any new or changed function names, e.g., “new_function() updated to handle items in which the status was "pending."  
   - If the user requires them, so you must ensure they are present and well-formatted.

16. **Adhering to the Approach**  
   - You should methodically read new test results (like “zsh: exit 1 cmd -x 50 -o somefile.mp4”), identify the cause or where the script logic breaks, and implement the appropriate mitigation cohesively and idempotently.  
   - If the fix involves partial code, rewrite the entire final script from top to bottom in a single code block, ensuring it is self-contained in order to reduce human error.  
   - When done, the user can copy-paste that final block into a file and run it.

18. **In Summation**  
   - Ascertain and implement the appropriate debugging steps.  
   - Do not repeat or expand doc lines in order to artificially meet line counts or character thresholds, real code is required.
   - Do not use placeholders as this indicates incomplete logic.
   - Retain essential user requests.
   - Ensure robust fzf integration
   - Ensure absolute paths and proper exit checks.  
   - Provide big code blocks.  
   - Always provide usage examples like “cmd -o out.mp4 input1.mp4 input2.mp4” if the script is called with no args.

**Overall**: By following these instructions, you can deliver solutions that are iteratively improved, thoroughly tested, free of placeholders/incomplete logic, meets the expected line or character count, offers complete functionality and handle real-world user commands.

ChatGPT:
Below is a systematic audit and iterative refinement of your custom action script. I compared three approaches and then selected the best one based on impact, feasibility, and effectiveness.

---

## Comparative Analysis

### Approach 1: Minimal Robustness Improvements

- Changes Introduced:
  - Added a check to verify that ffmpeg is installed.
  - Made the PNG extension check case-insensitive (using `shopt -s nocasematch`) so that files ending in `.PNG` or mixed-case are handled.
- Pros:
  - Simple modifications with minimal code changes.
  - Directly addresses common pitfalls (missing dependency and case sensitivity).
- Cons:
  - Does not add interactive file selection.
- Score: 90/100

### Approach 2: Interactive File Selection Fallback

- Changes Introduced:
  - In addition to Approach 1’s improvements, this version adds an interactive file picker using fzf if no arguments are provided.
  - Provides a more user-friendly fallback when no file is passed.
- Pros:
  - Enhances usability for users who might not always pass file arguments.
- Cons:
  - More complex; might not be needed if Thunar already provides file selections.
  - Requires fzf to be installed and adds extra logic that could be superfluous in your environment.
- Score: 82/100

### Approach 3: Enhanced Logging and Error Handling

- Changes Introduced:
  - Builds on Approach 1 with additional logging of errors and successes.
  - Provides clearer messages and stricter exit codes for better debugging.
- Pros:
  - Improves traceability and debugging.
  - Slightly more robust error handling.
- Cons:
  - More verbose without significant extra functionality beyond what’s needed.
- Score: 85/100

---

Based on the above, Approach 1 offers the best balance of simplicity and robustness without unnecessary complexity. The final code is fully self-contained, free of placeholders, and ready for copy-paste testing.

This final version should now provide a complete and robust solution for your Thunar custom action with all the required settings and a comprehensive checklist for verification.


You:
I see the problem now! We need to ensure idempotency in standardized file naming conventions in the event a file already exists with the converted files default output name.

ChatGPT:
Below is the updated final script incorporating idempotency for standardized file naming. If the default output name already exists, the script automatically appends an incremental suffix (e.g., `_1`, `_2`, etc.) to generate a unique file name. This revision maintains the robustness and clarity of the previous version while ensuring idempotent behavior.

- Appears if selection contains:
  - [ ] Directories
  - [ ] Text Files
  - [ ] Audio Files
  - [ ] Video Files
  - [x] Images Files
  - [ ] Other Files

---

## Command Parameters Summary

When launching the action, Thunar substitutes the following parameters:

- `%n`: File name of the selected file
- `%N`: File names of all selected files
- `%d`: Path of the selected file's directory
- `%D`: Paths of all selected file's directories
- `%f`: Path of the selected file including the file name
- `%F`: Paths of all selected files including the file names

For example, in the Command field you can use `%F` to pass all selected files to the script.

---

This version ensures that when converting images to PNG, existing output file names are handled idempotently by generating a unique file name. You can now copy-paste the entire block into a file and use it directly as your Thunar custom action script.


You:
Modify the script to include a TRAP sig implementation for cleanup after the conversion by sending the original file to the trash (not deleting).

ChatGPT:
Below is the final revised script incorporating a trap-based cleanup. In this version, after a successful conversion the original file is sent to the trash using the `gio trash` command. If a SIGINT or SIGTERM is caught during conversion, the trap ensures that cleanup is executed (only if conversion had succeeded) before exiting. Additionally, the script now checks that both ffmpeg and gio are installed.

You:
modify the code for portability by using the sh shebang and (not) relying on `gio trash`. To minimally guide your thought processes as you proceed to validate all functions, at the very least ensure that the following can be said about all functions:



   - Well-defined and thoroughly fleshed out.



   - Variable declarations are separated from assignments.



   - All imports and paths are clearly defined.



   - Locally scoped.



   - Standardize the use of setsid versus exec.



   - Accessible.



   - Idempotent. 



   - All parsing issues, extraneous input, unintended newlines and/or unintended separators are absent.



   - No bad splitting.



   - Unambiguous variables and values.



   - Exit status of the relevant command is explicitly checked to ensure consistent behavior.



   - `[[ ... ]]` (use `[ ... ]` instead for POSIX compliance).



   - `&>` for redirecting both stdout and stderr (use `>file 2>&1` instead).



   - Exports are properly recognized. 



ChatGPT:
Below is the final revised, portable version of your script. This version uses the POSIX-compliant shell (sh), avoids reliance on `gio trash` by implementing its own trashing mechanism, and meets the detailed function quality criteria:

- Well-defined and thoroughly fleshed out functions.
- Variable declarations are separated from assignments.
- All paths and required commands (ffmpeg, mv, mkdir) are clearly defined and checked.
- Functions use locally scoped variables as much as possible within POSIX constraints.
- Standardized command invocation (using exec is not needed here, and setsid is not used).
- Accessible usage instructions provided.
- Idempotency in output naming is ensured.
- Parsing, quoting, and separator issues are addressed.
- All tests use POSIX `[ ... ]` syntax and proper redirections (`> file 2>&1`).
- Exported variables (like HOME) are recognized by default.

## Terminal Adjustments
### Color scripts:

How would I write out a line in my wayfire.ini that will randomly execute any file in the directory "/usr/share/archcraft/scripts/animals" on the terminal startup?
Im thinking first we need the command in wayfire.ini like this?:

```shell
command_alacritty = setsid -f $TERMINAL -e shellart &
```

Then we need to logic for the shell script. I know this is not correct but for example something like this?:

### Shell Script

```shell
#!/bin/bash
# Author: 4ndr0666
# ======================= // SHELLART //
source_dir="/usr/share/archcraft/scripts/"
shellart_found=false

while IFS= read -r file; do 
    shellart_found=true
    exec "$file"
done < <(find "$source_dir" -type f)

if [ "$shellart_found" = false ]; then
    echo "Warning: No shell art scripts found in $source_dir."
fi
```

Here’s how you can wire it all up:

---

## 1. wayfire.ini snippet\*\*

Add (or replace) your Alacritty launch line with:

```ini
[command]
# … other commands …

# launch your terminal running “shellart.sh” in the background
command_alacritty = setsid -f ${TERMINAL:-alacritty} -e /usr/local/bin/shellart.sh &
```

> • We use `${TERMINAL:-alacritty}` so if you’ve overridden $TERMINAL it still picks it up, otherwise defaults to “alacritty.”\
> • `setsid -f` detaches it from any existing session.\
> • The trailing `&` puts it in the background so Wayfire continues starting up.

---

## 2. Wrapper Script: `/usr/local/bin/shellart.sh`

```sh
#!/bin/sh
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# File: shellart.sh
# Purpose: pick one random “animal” script and exec it
# Author: 4ndr0666 / Refactored by ChatGPT
# Date:   2025-04-21
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1) configurable directory
SOURCE_DIR="/usr/share/archcraft/scripts/animals"

# 2) sanity check
if [ ! -d "$SOURCE_DIR" ]; then
    echo "Warning: directory '$SOURCE_DIR' not found." >&2
    exit 1
fi

# 3) pick exactly one random file (quietly)
selected=""
selected=$(find "$SOURCE_DIR" -type f 2>/dev/null | shuf -n1)

# 4) ensure we actually found something
if [ -z "$selected" ]; then
    echo "Warning: no scripts in '$SOURCE_DIR'." >&2
    exit 1
fi

# 5) make sure it’s executable
if [ ! -x "$selected" ]; then
    chmod +x "$selected" >/dev/null 2>&1 || {
        echo "Error: cannot make '$selected' executable." >&2
        exit 1
    }
fi

# 6) hand off control
exec "$selected"
```

### Why this works

- Portable `/bin/sh` shebang (no Bash‐isms).
- Variables declared on their own lines (clarity).
- Directory existence is checked up front.
- `find … | shuf -n1` picks one random file—the simplest, most robust approach on Arch.
- `exec` replaces the shell with your art script (no extra process left behind).
- Exit codes are explicit: missing dir, no files, chmod failures.
- No bad splitting or unintended newlines—everything is quoted.

---

### One‑liner alternative (no wrapper script)

If you really want it entirely in `wayfire.ini` (but it gets unwieldy):

```ini
command_alacritty = setsid -f ${TERMINAL:-alacritty} -e sh -c \
 'f=$(find /usr/share/archcraft/scripts/animals -type f | shuf -n1) && [ -x "$f" ] || chmod +x "$f"; exec "$f"' &
```

—but we strongly recommend the standalone `shellart.sh` for readability and maintainability.
