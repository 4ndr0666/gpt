# projects

Welcome to the **projects** repository.

This repository serves as a workspace and template hub for starting, managing, and maintaining complex technical projects—especially those organized around modular scripts, configuration files, and detailed documentation.

## Project Initialization: The Role of `controller.md`

Every new project or suite of scripts in this repository should begin with a copy of the `controller.md` file.

### **What is `controller.md`?**

- **`controller.md` is the designated "controller" file for each project.**
- It formally declares one chat or discussion thread as the **central hub** (controller) for all project coordination, architectural decisions, audit tracking, and administrative actions.
- All project files—scripts, documentation, and manifests—are subordinate to the controller’s directives and decisions.

### **Purpose and Usage**

- The `controller.md` file documents:
  - The **structure and setup** for organizing scripts, manifests, and operational instructions.
  - The **operational charter** for the project, including governance, audit cycles, file naming standards, and assistant duties (if used with an AI assistant).
  - The workflow for **tracking, auditing, and updating** all project assets and knowledge.
- **For every new project:**
  1. Copy `controller.md` into the project’s directory or main repo.
  2. Use it to initiate and log all high-level planning, file additions, audits, and refactors.
  3. Update it as the authoritative log for all major project decisions and status changes.

### **Why use `controller.md`?**

- Ensures a **single source of truth** for project organization and history.
- Maintains rigorous traceability and governance as projects scale in complexity.
- Makes onboarding, handoffs, and future audits seamless.

### Root Directory

* **README.md**:
  Onboarding and usage guide for all contributors and project leads.
* **controller.md**:
  Declares this repo’s (or project’s) controller chat, acting as the canonical hub for all administrative decisions, file tracking, and integration.
* **init\_projects.md**:
  Step-by-step guide or template for starting a new project (optional but recommended).
* **Project Directories**:
  Each project or major domain has its own directory (e.g., `sysadmin/`, `networking/`).

### Inside Each Project Directory

* **index.md**:
  Master manifest for the project—tracks every file, its status, line count, and audit trail.
* **instructions.md**:
  Operational charter—defines workflow rules, standards, assistant duties, and update protocols.
* **chats/** (or similar):
  Folder containing all technical scripts, markdowns, and documentation, grouped by topic or function (e.g., `permissions.md`, `iso.md`).

## Getting Started

1. Copy `controller.md` from this repository into your new or existing project directory.
2. Follow the documented structure and workflow to initialize your project and manage all assets moving forward.
3. Keep `controller.md` up to date as the project evolves.

---

## Why This Structure?

* **Centralized Control:**
  All governance, decisions, and audits occur through the controller, ensuring zero drift or ambiguity.
* **Scalable:**
  Supports any number of parallel projects/domains without cross-contamination or confusion.
* **Traceable:**
  Every script, update, or audit is logged and cross-referenced for robust versioning and onboarding.
* **Efficient Collaboration:**
  Contributors always know where to find instructions, the manifest, and the canonical record of project logic.

*For more details, see the comments and structure inside `controller.md` itself and the project-specific `instructions.md`.*

## **Thread Naming Convention**

To ensure every new discussion, activity log, or support request is easily searchable and chronologically organized, use the following standardized naming convention for new threads:

### **Structure:**

```
[YYYY-MM-DD] [CATEGORY] — [Summary/Topic]
```

* `[YYYY-MM-DD]`: Date of thread creation (e.g., `2025-05-27`)
* `[CATEGORY]`: Classification of the thread (choose one):
  `Q&A`, `Debug`, `Scripting`, `Refactor`, `Activity Log`, `Review`
* `[Summary/Topic]`: Brief, descriptive summary of the thread's main focus

---

### **Examples:**

* `2025-05-27 Debug — Pacman Dependency Issue`
* `2025-05-27 Scripting — Bash Function for Backups`
* `2025-05-27 Q&A — Mount Options for SSD Performance`
* `2025-05-27 Activity Log — Update Kernel to 6.8`

---

### **Quick Reference Table:**

| Example Title                                       | When to Use                     |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 2025-05-27 Debug — Pacman Dependency Issue          | Bug/conflict analysis           |
| 2025-05-27 Scripting — Bash Function for Backups    | Script/procedure discussion     |
| 2025-05-27 Q\&A — Mount Options for SSD Performance | General sysadmin best practices |
| 2025-05-27 Activity Log — Update Kernel to 6.8      | Logging admin activities        |

---

**Usage Notes:**

* Always use this convention for new threads to maintain order and traceability.
* Threads should be easy to scan for context, topic, and chronology.
* Adjust the `[CATEGORY]` and `[Summary/Topic]` fields to suit the content.

*This convention supports automated project auditing, searching, and future scripting or aggregation. See `controller.md` for more details and project governance rules.*
