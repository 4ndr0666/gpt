# Data Collection Guidelines

This document provides guidelines for collecting and documenting data during the Quantum-Linked Twin Interaction Study.

## General Guidelines

- **Consistency:**  
  Ensure that the same tools and methods are used in both the Baseline and Intervention phases.
  
- **Documentation:**  
  Record every interaction session in detail using the provided observation diary template. Note:
  - Date and time
  - Location
  - Names or identifiers of all participants
  - Description of the interaction
  - Observations of behavior and any notable events

- **Survey Administration:**  
  Administer surveys immediately before and after the interaction sessions. Keep responses confidential and record them accurately.

- **Consent:**  
  Always secure informed consent from all participants, especially if recording audio or video.

## Tools and Templates

- **Observation Diary Template:**  
  Use the attached template to ensure all important details are captured.
  
- **Survey Questionnaire:**  
  Standardized questions on group cohesion, emotional tone, and interaction quality.

## Data Storage and Privacy

- **Anonymization:**  
  Remove all personal identifiers from the data before analysis.
  
- **Secure Storage:**  
  Store digital files in a secure, access-controlled environment. Physical documents should be kept in locked cabinets.

## Quality Assurance

- **Regular Reviews:**  
  Periodically review the collected data for consistency and completeness.
  
- **Feedback Sessions:**  
  Conduct group feedback sessions with participants to validate observational data and survey responses.

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing Data:**  
  If data is missing for any session, document the reason (e.g., participant withdrawal, technical failure) and adjust analysis accordingly.
  
- **Inconsistent Data:**  
  Flag and review any data points that significantly deviate from expected norms, and consider potential causes.
