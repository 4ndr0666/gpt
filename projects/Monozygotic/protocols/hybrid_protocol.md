# Hybrid Observational Protocol (Mixed Methods)

## Objective

To integrate both naturalistic observation and controlled experimentation, thereby providing a comprehensive overview of the twin’s impact on human interaction dynamics.

## Setup

- **Longitudinal Observation:**
  - Maintain an observation diary over 3–6 months.
  - Record everyday interactions with and without the twin.

- **Scheduled Controlled Sessions:**
  - Organize mini-experiments (e.g., cooperative tasks) on a bi-weekly or monthly basis.
  - Alternate between sessions with and without the twin.

## Data Collection

- **Observation Logs:**
  - Daily logs capturing qualitative data.
- **Structured Surveys:**
  - Administer surveys before and after controlled sessions.
- **Participant Feedback:**
  - Hold regular debriefings to gather additional insights.
- **Combined Data Metrics:**
  - Merge spontaneous observational data with controlled experiment results for a holistic analysis.

## Analysis

- **Correlation Analysis:**
  - Compare qualitative and quantitative data to identify any converging trends.
- **Mixed-Methods Reporting:**
  - Use tables, graphs, and narrative summaries to present findings.
- **Comprehensive Report:**
  - Compile a final report that details the methods, results, and interpretations.
