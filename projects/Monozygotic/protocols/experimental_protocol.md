# Experimental Observational Protocol

## Objective

To systematically evaluate interpersonal dynamics under controlled conditions, comparing interactions with and without the presence of a monozygotic twin.

## Setup

- **Participants:**
  - A consistent group of 3–5 individuals.
  - Primary participant and monozygotic twin.
  
- **Controlled Tasks:**
  - Pre-defined activities (e.g., cooperative puzzles, structured discussions).
  - Each task is performed twice:
    1. Without the twin.
    2. With the twin present.
  - Randomize the order of conditions to avoid bias.

## Session Structure

- **Pre-Interaction:**
  - Administer surveys to gauge baseline group cohesion.
  
- **During Interaction:**
  - Record session details (audio/video if permitted).
  - A designated observer or facilitator codes behavior:
    - Speaking frequency
    - Interruptions
    - Non-verbal cues

- **Post-Interaction:**
  - Re-administer surveys to capture any shifts in perceptions.
  
## Data Collection Tools

- **Pre/Post Surveys:**  
  - Use standardized scales (e.g., Group Cohesion Scale).
- **Behavioral Coding:**  
  - Create a checklist for observable metrics.
- **Physiological Data:** *(Optional)*
  - Record metrics such as heart rate variability.

## Analysis

- **Statistical Analysis:**
  - Compare quantitative metrics (t-tests, ANOVA).
- **Thematic Analysis:**
  - Analyze qualitative feedback for recurring themes.
- **Reporting:**
  - Generate a detailed report combining both qualitative and quantitative results.
